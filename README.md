# Introduction
CompendiumGenerator is a utility designed to improve the gaming experience of tabletop role-playing enthusiasts. The software harnesses the vastness of open-sourced RPG data sets, parses and interprets them, transforming these resources into comprehensive compendiums.

These compendiums, which may include data on a wide variety of subjects such as characters, equipment, spells, monsters, and story plots, are then made compatible with the widely acclaimed Campaign Logger program. 

Whether you're in the middle of an epic campaign or just getting started with your RPG journey, CompendiumGenerator is the bridge between the wealth of open-source resources and your personalized campaign log.
