A "roll table", also known as a random encounter table or loot table, in a tabletop role-playing game is a
mechanic used to introduce unpredictability and randomness into the game. It is a pre-made list of outcomes
that is typically indexed by the roll of one or more dice. For instance, the GM (Game Master) may ask a
player to roll percentile dice (also known as d100), with the outcome determining what creature the players
might meet, what loot they might find, or what event might happen based on what number the dice lands on in the table.

Roll tables are often used in games like {GameSystem} and can be made for different situations, including
random NPC encounters, finding treasure, determining events, and more. They can range from very simple to highly
complex, depending on the needs of the game and the creativity of the GM. Overall, they are tools designed
to enhance immersion and maintain surprise elements in the game.

Create a d100 roll table with the following specifications:
- Roll Table Name: {Name}
- TTRPG Genre: {Genre}
- TTRPG Game System: {GameSystem}
- Overall Sentiment: {Sentiment}
- Roll Table Subject: {PromptInput}

Output should be in markdown table format with the following layout:
- Header containing roll table name
- Introductory paragraph describing the purpose of the roll table
- A brief example dialogue between a player and a game master that demonstrates how the table will be used.
- The roll table itself in markdown format.

Do not include any other comments in the output.

Do not truncate or abbreviate the table.  Please generate it in its entirety.
