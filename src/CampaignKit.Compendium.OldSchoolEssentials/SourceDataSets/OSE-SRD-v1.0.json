      "rawPublic": "## Ability Scores\n\nThe basic physical and mental strengths and weaknesses of the character. There are 6 ability scores: _**Strength**_ (abbreviated STR), _**Intelligence**_ (INT), _**Wisdom**_ (WIS), _**Dexterity**_ (DEX), _**Constitution**_ (CON), and _**Charisma**_ (CHA). A character is ranked in each ability score by a number between 3–18. (3 being the worst score possible and 18 the best.)\n\n## Class\n\nAn adventuring profession to which the character belongs. A character’s class defines their main abilities. See [Character Classes](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Character_Classes \"Character Classes\").\n\n## Race\n\nA character may be human or one of a number of demihuman species. Unless a demihuman class is selected, the character is assumed to be human.\n\n## Level\n\nThe character’s experience as an adventurer is denoted by their experience level. Characters typically start play at 1st level (the lowest level of adventurer) and can increase in level through successful adventuring. As a character goes up in level, they gain more powerful abilities, as defined by their class.\n\n## Experience Points (XP)\n\nThe character’s advancement in the game is tracked by the accumulation of [experience points](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Experience \"Experience\"). Experience points are [awarded](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Awarding_XP \"Awarding XP\") by the [referee](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/The_Referee%E2%80%99s_Role \"The Referee’s Role\") after a successful adventure. When the character has accumulated a certain number of experience points, the character’s level increases. Each class specifies the number of experience points required to achieve each experience level.\n\n## Prime Requisite\n\nThe [ability score](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Ability_Scores \"Ability Scores\") (or scores) that are the most important to the character’s class. The character’s score in these abilities can affect the rate at which the character accumulates experience points.\n\n## Alignment\n\nThe character (and every other creature in the game world) is aligned with one of three cosmic principles: Law, Neutrality, or Chaos (see [Alignment](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Alignment \"Alignment\"). This alignment determines how certain magic influences the character and should be used by the player as a guideline for role-playing the character.\n\n## Hit Points (hp)\n\nThe character’s ability to avoid dying. The character has a _**maximum hit point total**_ and a _**current hit point total**_, which are tracked separately. When a character is harmed, their current hit point total is reduced. If this number reaches 0, the character is dead! Rest or healing can restore lost hit points see [Damage, Healing, and Death](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Damage,_Healing,_and_Death \"Damage, Healing, and Death\"), but never above the character’s maximum hit point total (this is only increased when the character increases in level).\n\n## Hit Dice (HD)\n\nThe number of dice used to determine the character’s maximum hit point total. The character’s level determines the number of Hit Dice and their class determines the type of dice rolled (i.e. d4, d6, d8). (Some classes also grant a flat bonus to hit points at certain levels.)\n\n## Armour Class (AC)\n\nThe character’s ability to avoid damage in combat. AC is determined by the character’s armour and their Dexterity score. Lower Armour Class scores are better, so bonuses decrease the character’s AC and penalties increase it.\n\n**Dual format:** The equivalent ascending AC is listed in square brackets, for groups using the optional rule for Ascending AC. (e.g. AC 5 \\[14\\] — an AC of 5, or 14 if using the optional rule for Ascending AC.)\n\n**Unarmoured AC:** An unarmoured character has AC 9 \\[10\\].\n\n## Ascending AC (Optional Rule)\n\nSome groups are more familiar with an Armour Class system where higher scores are better. This system is known as Ascending Armour Class (abbreviated AAC) and works as follows:\n\n*   **Armour Class:** When using AAC, higher scores are better. Bonuses to Armour Class increase the AAC score and penalties decrease it.\n*   **Attack rolls:** When using AAC, the procedure for resolving attack rolls involves the use of an attack bonus instead of a THAC0 score and attack matrix.\n\n**Note:** Using Ascending Armour Class results in very slightly different attack probabilities than when using the traditional approach of descending AC with an [attack matrix](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Combat_Tables \"Combat Tables\").\n\n## Attack Roll “to Hit AC 0” (THAC0)\n\nThe character’s ability to hit foes in combat, determined by their class and level. The THAC0 score indicates which row of the attack matrix (see [Combat Tables](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Combat_Tables \"Combat Tables\")) to use when attacking. Lower THAC0 scores are better.\n\n**Dual format:** The equivalent attack bonus is listed in square brackets, for groups using the optional rule for Ascending AC. (e.g. THAC0 15 [\\+4] — a THAC0 of 15, or an attack bonus of +4 if using the optional rule for Ascending AC.)\n\n**Attacking:** The procedure for making attack rolls is described in [Combat](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Combat \"Combat\").\n\n## Saving Throw Values\n\nThe character’s ability to avoid certain dangerous or detrimental effects. There are five saving throw categories: death (or poison), wands, paralysis (or petrification), breath attacks, spells (or magic rods or staves). The character’s saving throw values are determined by class and level. See [Saving Throws](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Saving_Throws \"Saving Throws\") for full details.\n\n## Movement Rate\n\nThe speed at which the character can move when exploring, travelling, or during combat. Every character has a _**base movement rate**_ and an _**encounter movement rate**_ (noted in parentheses). The encounter movement rate is one third of the base movement rate. The default movement rate for characters is 120’ (40’)—a base movement rate of 120’ and an encounter movement rate of 40’.\n\n*   **Overland:** The number of miles a character can travel in a day in the wilderness is determined by dividing their base movement rate by five.\n*   **Exploration:** When exploring unknown areas of a dungeon, characters can move their base movement rate in feet per turn (10 minutes)\n\n## Class Abilities\n\nFinally, the character’s class denotes a set of special abilities that the character may use, including the ability to use certain types of armour and weapons and to speak one or more [languages](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Languages \"Languages\").",

Roll d% and consult the table below.\n\n### Teleport Result\n\n| Knowledge of Dest.| Ground Level| Too High| Too Low|\n| :--- | :---- | :--- | :--- |\nScant| 01–50 | 51–75 | 76–00 |\nModerate| 01–80 | 81–90 | 91–00 |\nExact| 01–95 | 096–99 | 96–99 | 00 |\n\n**Ground level:** The subject appears at the intended destination.\n\n**Too high:** The subject appears 1d10×10’ above the intended destination. If this causes the subject to appear inside solid matter, they die instantly. Otherwise, the subject falls from a height.\n\n**Too low:** The subject appears below the surface of the ground and dies instantly.\n\n**Knowledge of destination:** The caster’s knowledge of the destination is rated as follows:\n\n* **Scant:** A location that the caster has visited once or twice, has seen by magical scrying, or has heard of from descriptions.\n\n* **Moderate:** A location that the caster has visited often or has studied via scrying for several weeks.\n\n* **Exact:** A location that the caster has made a detailed study of, in person.\n",

There are many subspecies of dragon, many of which are distinguished by the colour of their scales. All dragons are egg-layers and hoard treasure in their lairs, far from areas of human civilisation.  \nstats:\n- Behaviour: Chaotic dragons usually try to eat humans, but may sometimes capture them. Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties worthy of the honour.\n- Pride: Dragons are immensely proud creatures and will always listen to flattery.\n- Attack pattern: A dragon always attacks first with its breath weapon, then either breathes again or makes melee attacks (equal chance of either).\n- Breath weapon: Can be used up to three times per day. All caught in the area suffer damage equal to the dragon’s current hit points (save versus breath for half). Shapes of breath weapon: \n- Cloud: 50’ long, 40’ wide, 20’ high.\n- Cone: 2’ wide at the mouth, 30’ wide at far end.\n- Line: 5’ wide along whole length.\n- Energy immunity: Unharmed by their own breath weapon or lesser versions thereof. Automatically save versus similar attack forms. (For example, a red dragon is immune to flaming oil and suffers half damage from fire ball spells.)\n- Language and spells: Some dragons are able to speak (their own tongue plus Common). The chance is listed by subspecies. Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected magic-user spells (the listed number and level of spells).\n- Sleeping: The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus to hit. Dragons may sometimes pretend to be asleep!\n- Subduing: Will surrender if reduced to 0hp by non-lethal attacks (see Subduing), admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the damage done by the breath weapon.) A subdued dragon will attempt to escape or attack its captors, if the opportunity presents itself or if given a suicidal command. A subdued dragon may be sold for up to 1,000gp per hp.\n- Age: The following stats describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less and ¼ or ½ as much treasure. Older dragons may have up to 3 HD more and twice as much treasure.\n- Lairs: A dragon’s treasure is always kept in its well-hidden lair and is seldom unguarded.\ntraits:\n```\n\n~\"Black Dragon\"\n~\"Blue Dragon\"\n~\"Gold Dragon\"\n~\"Green Dragon\"\n~\"Red Dragon\"\n~\"Sea Dragon\"\n~\"White Dragon\"",
