You overextend your swing and lose your balance, falling prone.\n3. Your attack hits an ally standing adjacent to your target.\n4. Your attack strikes an object in the environment (such as a nearby vase or statue) and destroys it.\n5. Your weapon becomes lodged in a nearby wall or obstacle, taking a full action to retrieve.\n6. You accidentally hit a pressure plate or tripwire, triggering a nearby trap.\n7. Your attack misses so wildly that it strikes a different foe standing nearby.\n8. You overexert yourself and suffer one point of exhaustion.\n9. Your weapon breaks in the midst of the attack, becoming useless.\n10. You accidentally damage a magical item carried by an ally or yourself.\n11. Your attack does half damage to yourself as you recoil with the weapon.\n12. Your attack hits your enemy's armor, causing them to become enraged and take an extra attack.\n13. You slip on a puddle of water or patch of ice and fall prone.\n14. Your weapon becomes stuck in a bone or armor joint, doubling the time to retrieve it.\n15. Your attack misses so wildly that you hit an environmental object (like a torch) and extinguish it.\n16. You accidentally hit an innocent bystander in the heat of combat.\n17. Your attack causes an environmental hazard (like a fire) to ignite or grow larger.\n18. You lose grip on your weapon and must spend a full action to regain it.\n19. Your weapon flies out of your grasp and lands several feet away.\n20.
