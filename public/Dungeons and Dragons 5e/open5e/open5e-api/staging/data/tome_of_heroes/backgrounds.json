Most make an effort to adjust their habits and imitate those around them, but not all. Some lean into their differences, reveling in shocking those around them.\n  When you choose a creature to be your character's adopted parent, think about how that might affect your character.

Did your character seek constant escape or do they miss their adopted parents?\n\n| d8 | Personality Trait                                                                            |\n|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | I don't eat my friends (at least not while they are alive).

You might have been trained by an old, grizzled city watchman, or you might have been pressed into service by the local magistrate for your superior skills, size, or intellect. However you came to the role, you excelled at defending others.\n  You have a nose for trouble, a keen eye for spotting threats, a strong arm to back it up, and you are canny enough to know when to act. Most importantly, though, you were a peace officer or a protector and not a member of an army which might march to war.\n\n***Specialization***\nEach person or location that hires a sentry comes with its own set of unique needs and responsibilities.

        "feature-desc": "The knowing look from the caravan guard to the city gatekeeper or the nod of recognition between the noble's bodyguard and the district watchman—no matter the community, city, or town, the guards share a commonality of purpose. When you arrive in a new location, you can speak briefly with the gate guards, local watch, or other community guardians to gain local knowledge. This knowledge could be information, such as the most efficient routes through the city, primary vendors for a variety of luxury goods, the best (or worst) inns and taverns, the primary criminal elements in town, or the current conflicts in the community.",
        "suggested-characteristics": "You're a person who understands both patience and boredom, as a guard is always waiting for something to happen. More often than not, sentries hope nothing happens because something happening usually means something has gone wrong. A life spent watching and protecting, acting in critical moments, and learning the details of places and behaviors; all of these help shape the personality of the former sentry.
