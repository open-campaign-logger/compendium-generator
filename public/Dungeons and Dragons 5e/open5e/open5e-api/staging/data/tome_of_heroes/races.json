You have resistance to necrotic damage and poison damage, you are immune to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or poisoned. When you finish a short rest, you can reduce your exhaustion level by 1, provided you have ingested at least 1 pound of raw meat in the last 24 hours (see Hunger for Flesh).\n\n***Undead Vitality.*** You don't need to breathe, and you don't sleep the way most creatures do. Instead, you enter a dormant state that resembles death, remaining semiconscious, for 6 hours a day. While dormant, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.\n\n***Heritage Subrace.*** You were something else before you became a darakhul.

Armor and helms worn by the gearforged are often styled to appear as if they were integrated into its chassis, making it all-but-impossible to tell where the armor ends and the gearforged begins.",

In addition, you have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, and Religion.\n\n***Carrier of Rot.*** You can use your action to inflict rot on a creature you can see within 10 feet of you. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails the saving throw also rots for 1 minute. A rotting creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns. The target or a creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to excise the rot with a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check. The DC for the check equals the rot's Constitution saving throw DC. The rot also disappears if the target receives magical healing. The damage for the initial action and the rotting increases to 2d4 at 6th level, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 16th level. After you use your Carrier of Rot trait, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest."

You become translucent and devoid of color, and the air around you grows cold. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you have a flying speed of 30 feet with the ability to hover, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't made with silvered weapons. In addition, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple or against being restrained, and you can move through creatures and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside an object, you take 1d10 force damage. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n***Imperfect Undeath.*** You are a humanoid, but your partial transition into undeath makes you susceptible to effects that target undead. Though you can regain hit points from spells like cure wounds, you can also be affected by game effects that specifically target undead, such as a cleric's Turn Undead feature. Game effects that raise a creature from the dead work on you as normal, but they return you to life as a shade. A true resurrection or wish spell can restore you to life as a fully living member of your original race.\n\n***Life Drain.*** When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell, you can choose to deal extra necrotic damage to the target equal to your level. If the creature's race matches your Living Origin, you gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n***Spectral Resilience.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease, and you have resistance to necrotic damage.\n\n***Living Origin.*** As living echoes of who they once were, shades maintain some of the traits they bore in life. Choose another race as your Living Origin. This is the race you were in life. Your size and speed are those of your Living Origin, and you know one language spoken by your Living Origin."
