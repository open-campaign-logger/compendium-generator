In its material form, it has resistance to damage from nonmagical attacks. In its ethereal form, it is immune to damage from nonmagical attacks. The creature's ethereal form appears as a dark purple outline of its material form, with a blackish-purple haze within. A nihileth in ethereal form can move through air as though it were water, with a fly speed of 40 feet.\r\n- Void Aura: >\r\n    The undead nihileth is surrounded by a chilling cloud. A living creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a nihileth must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be slowed until the start of its next turn. In addition, any creature that has been diseased by a nihileth or a nihilethic zombie takes 7 (2d6) cold damage every time it starts its turn within the aura.\r\n- Infecting Telepathy: >\r\n    If a creature communicates telepathically with the nihileth, or uses a psychic attack against it, the nihileth can spread its disease to the creature.

The nihileth cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row.\r\n    - Void Absorbance: A nihileth can pull the life force from those it has converted to nihilethic zombies to replenish its own life. This takes 18 (6d6) hit points from zombies within 30 feet of the nihileth, spread evenly between the zombies, and healing the nihileth. If a zombie reaches 0 hit points from this action, it perishes with no Undead Fortitude saving throw.\r\n- Regional Effects: >\r\n    the regional effects of a nihileth's lair are the same as that of an aboleth, except as following.\r\n    - Water sources within 1 mile of a nihileth's lair are not only supernaturally fouled but can spread the disease of the nihileth. A creature who drinks from such water must make a successful DC 14 Constitution check or become infected.\r\nactions:\r\n- Multiattack: >\r\n    The nihileth makes three tentacle attacks or three withering touches, depending on what form it is in.\r\n- Tentacle (Material Form Only): >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target creature is hit, it must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute; during that time, it can be removed by lesser restoration or comparable magic. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy. The creature cannot regain hit points unless it is entirely underwater, and the disease can only be removed by heal or comparable magic. Unless the creature is fully submerged or frequently doused with water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes. If a creature dies while diseased, it rises in 1d6 rounds as a nihilethic zombie. This zombie is permanently dominated by the nihileth.\r\n- Withering Touch (Ethereal Form Only): >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) necrotic damage.\r\n- Form Swap: >\r\n    As a bonus action, the nihileth can alter between its material and ethereal forms at will.\r\n- Tail (Material Form Only): >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.\r\n- Enslave (3/day): >\r\n    The nihileth targets one creature it can see within 30 ft. of it.

The charmed target is under the nihileth's control and can't take reactions, and the nihileth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

The creature cannot regain hit points unless it is at least partially underwater, and the disease can only be removed by heal or comparable magic. Unless the creature is either fully submerged or frequently doused with water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes.

All of its remaining hit points transfer to the nihileth in the form of healing. The nihilethic zombie is reduced to 0 hit points and it doesn't make an Undead Fortitude saving throw. A nihileth cannot be healed above its maximum hit points in this manner.\r\n- Reactions: The Nihilethic Zombie has the following reactions.\r\n- Void Body: >\r\n    The nihilethic zombie can reduce the damage it takes from a single source by 1d12 points. This reduction cannot be applied to radiant damage.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"Tome of Beasts OGL\"\r\n",

Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.\r\n    The dragon can choose to transform only part of its body with this action, allowing it to sprout rabbit-like ears or a humanoid head. These changes are purely cosmetic and don’t alter statistics.\r\n- Legendary Actions: The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\r\n-  Detect: >\r\n    The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.\r\n-  Tail Attack: >\r\n    The dragon makes a tail attack.\r\n-  Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions): >\r\n    The dragon casts a spell from its list of innate spells, consuming a use of the spell as normal.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"Tome of Beasts 2 OGL\"\r\n",

You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric-performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.\n\nChoose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.\r\n* {b|Skill Profficiencies}: Insight, Religion\r\n* {b|Languages}: Two of your choice\r\n* {b|Equipment}: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp\r\n## Shelter of the Faithful\r\nAs an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.\n\nYou might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.\r\n## Suggested Characteristics\r\nAcolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals.

      "rawText": "# Destined\r\nDuty is a complicated, tangled affair, be it filial, political, or civil. Sometimes, there's wealth and intrigue involved, but more often than not, there's also obligation and responsibility. You are a person with just such a responsibility. This could involve a noble title, an arranged marriage, a family business you're expected to administer, or an inherited civil office. You promised to fulfill this responsibility, you are desperately trying to avoid this duty, or you might even be seeking the person intended to be at your side. Regardless of the reason, you're on the road, heading toward or away from your destiny.\n\n***Destiny***\nYou're a person who's running from something or hurtling headfirst towards something, but just what is it? The responsibility or event might be happily anticipated or simply dreaded; either way, you're committed to the path. Choose a destiny or roll a d8 and consult the table below.\n\n| d8 | Destiny                                                                                                                  |\n|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | You are running away from a marriage.                                                                                     |\n| 2  | You are seeking your runaway betrothed.                                                                                   |\n| 3  | You don't want to take over your famous family business.                                                                  |\n| 4  | You need to arrive at a religious site at a specific time to complete an event or prophecy.                               |\n| 5  | Your noble relative died, and you're required to take their vacant position.                                              |\n| 6  | You are the reincarnation of a famous figure, and you're expected to live in an isolated temple.                          |\n| 7  | You were supposed to serve an honorary but dangerous position in your people's military.                                  |\n| 8  | Members of your family have occupied a civil office (court scribe, sheriff, census official, or similar) for generations. |\r\n* {b|Skill Profficiencies}: History, Insight\r\n* {b|Languages}: One of your choice\r\n* {b|Equipment}: A dagger, quarterstaff, or spear, a set of traveler's clothes, a memento of your destiny (a keepsake from your betrothed, the seal of your destined office, your family signet ring, or similar), a belt pouch containing 15 gp\r\n## Reputation of Opportunity\r\nYour story precedes you, as does your quest to claim—or run away from—your destiny. Those in positions of power, such as nobles, bureaucrats, rich merchants, and even mercenaries and brigands, all look to either help or hinder you, based on what they think they may get out of it. They're always willing to meet with you briefly to see just how worthwhile such aid or interference might be. This might mean a traveler pays for your passage on a ferry, a generous benefactor covers your group's meals at a tavern, or a local governor invites your adventuring entourage to enjoy a night's stay in their guest quarters. However, the aid often includes an implied threat or request. Some might consider delaying you as long as politely possible, some might consider taking you prisoner for ransom or to do “what's best” for you, and others might decide to help you on your quest in exchange for some future assistance. You're never exactly sure of the associated “cost” of the person's aid until the moment arrives. In the meantime, the open road awaits.\r\n## Suggested Characteristics\r\nDestined characters might be running toward or away from destiny, but whatever the case, their destiny has shaped them. Think about the impact of your destiny on you and the kind of relationship you have with your destiny. Do you embrace it? Accept it as inevitable? Or do you fight it every step of the way?\n\n| d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                                            |\n|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | I'm eager to find this destiny and move on with the next stage in my life.                                                                   |\n| 2  | I keep the fire of my hope burning bright.

You expected to live all your days in the forest, at one with the green things of the world, until an unforeseen occurrence, traumatic or transformative, drove you from your familiar home and into the larger world.

If you spend 1 hour observing, examining, and exploring your surroundings while in a forest, you are able to identify a safe location to rest. The area is protected from all but the most extreme elements and from the nonmagical native beasts of the forest. In addition, you are able to find sufficient kindling for a small fire throughout the night.\n\n ***Life-Changing Event***\nYou have lived a simple life deep in the sheltering boughs of the forest, be it as a trapper, farmer, or villager eking out a simple existence in the forest.

Eclipse: Eclipses plunge the world into darkness and strengthen connections to the shadow plane. When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower that causes necrotic damage, you can reroll a number of damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. Nova: The nova is a powerful aid to divination spells. You can treat one divination spell you cast as though you had used a spell slot one level higher than the slot actually used.\r\n* {b|Range}: Self\r\n* {b|Components}: V, S, M\r\n* {b|Ritual}: yes\r\n* {b|Duration}: 24 Hours\r\n* {b|Concentration}: no\r\n* {b|Casting Time}: 1 hour\r\n* {b|Level Int}: 9\r\n* {b|School}: conjuration\r\n* {b|Class}: Wizard\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"Deep Magic Extended\"\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Door of the Far Traveler\r\nDeep Magic: liminal You conjure a door to the destination of your choice that lasts for the duration or until dispelled. You sketch the outline of the door with chalk on any hard surface (a wall, a cliffside, the deck of a ship, etc.) and scribe sigils of power around its outline. The doorway must be at least 1 foot wide by 2 feet tall and can be no larger than 5 feet wide by 10 feet tall. Once the door is drawn, place the knob appropriately; it attaches magically to the surface and your drawing becomes a real door to the spell's destination. The doorway remains functional for the spell's duration. During that time, anyone can open or close the door and pass through it in either direction. The destination can be on any plane of existence. It must be familiar to you, and your level of familiarity with it determines the accuracy of the spell (determined by the GM). If it's a place you've visited, you can expect 100 percent accuracy. If it's been described to you by someone who was there, you might arrive in the wrong room or even the wrong structure, depending on how detailed their description was. If you've only heard about the destination third-hand, you may end up in a similar structure that's in a very different locale. Door of the far traveler doesn't create a doorway at the destination. It connects to an existing, working door. It can't, for example, take you to an open field or a forest with no structures (unless someone built a doorframe with a door in that spot for this specific purpose!). While the spell is in effect, the pre-existing doorway connects only to the area you occupied while casting the spell. If you connected to an existing doorway between a home's parlor and library, for example, and your door leads into the library, then people can still walk through that doorway from the parlor into the library normally. Anyone trying to go the other direction, however, arrives wherever you came from instead of in the parlor. Before casting the spell, you must spend one hour etching magical symbols onto the doorknob that will serve as the spell's material component to attune it to your desired destination. Once prepared, the knob remains attuned to that destination until it's used or you spend another hour attuning it to a different location. The door of the far traveler is dispelled if you remove the knob from the door. You can do this as a bonus action from either side of the door, provided it's shut. If the spell's duration expires naturally, the knob falls to the ground on whichever side of the door you're on. Once the spell ends, the knob loses its attunement to any location and another hour must be spent attuning it before it can be used again.\r\n* {b|Range}: 10 Feet\r\n* {b|Components}: V, S, M\r\n* {b|Ritual}: no\r\n* {b|Duration}: 6 Hours\r\n* {b|Concentration}: no\r\n* {b|Casting Time}: 10 minutes\r\n* {b|Level Int}: 8\r\n* {b|HigherLevel}: If you cast this spell using a 9th-level slot, the duration increases to twelve hours.\r\n* {b|School}: conjuration\r\n* {b|Class}: Wizard, Druid, Cleric, Bard\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"Warlock Archives\"\r\n",

On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. \n \nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor: \n \n* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. \n* When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table. \n* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. \n \nIf you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. \n \nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. \n \nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. \n \n### Unarmored Defense \n \nWhile you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. \n \n### Reckless Attack \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. \n \n### Danger Sense \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. \n \nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. \n \n### Primal Path \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Fast Movement \n \nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor. \n \n### Feral Instinct \n \nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. \n \nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn. \n \n### Brutal Critical \n \nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. \n \nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level. \n \n### Relentless Rage \n \nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. \n \nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. \n \n### Persistent Rage \n \nBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it. \n \n### Indomitable Might \n \nBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total. \n \n### Primal Champion \n \nAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.\r\n## Primal Paths\r\n### Path of the Berserker\r\nFor some barbarians, rage is a means to an end- that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being. \n \n##### Frenzy \n \nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A). \n \n##### Mindless Rage \n \nBeginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage. \n \n##### Intimidating Presence \n \nBeginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you. \n \nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours. \n \n##### Retaliation \n \nStarting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"5e Core Rules\"\r\n",

You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table. \n \n#### Spell Slots \n \nThe Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *cure wounds* using either slot. \n \n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \n \nYou know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. \n \nThe Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. \n \n### Bardic Inspiration \n \nYou can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. \n \nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. \n \nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. \n \nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. \n \n### Jack of All Trades \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus. \n \n### Song of Rest \n \nBeginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points. \n \nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level. \n \n### Bard College \n \nAt 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of \n \nthe class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level. \n \n### Expertise \n \nAt 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. \n \nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Font of Inspiration \n \nBeginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest. \n \n### Countercharm \n \nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required). \n \n### Magical Secrets \n \nBy 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. \n \nThe chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table. \n \nYou learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level. \n \n### Superior Inspiration \n \nAt 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.\r\n## Bard Colleges\r\n### College of Lore\r\nBards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king. \n \nThe loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic. \n \nThe college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority. \n \n##### Bonus Proficiencies \n \nWhen you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice. \n \n##### Cutting Words \n \nAlso at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed. \n \n##### Additional Magical Secrets \n \nAt 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know. \n \n##### Peerless Skill \n \nStarting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"5e Core Rules\"\r\n",

You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four \n1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n#### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. \n \n### Divine Domain \n \nChoose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. \n \n#### Domain Spells \n \nEach domain has a list of spells-its domain spells- that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. \n \nIf you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. \n \n### Channel Divinity \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. \n \nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. \n \nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. \n \nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel \n \nDivinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. \n \n#### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead \n \nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. \n \nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Destroy Undead \n \nStarting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table. \n \n**Destroy Undead (table)** \n \n| Cleric Level | Destroys Undead of CR... | \n|--------------|--------------------------| \n| 5th          | 1/2 or lower             | \n| 8th          | 1 or lower               | \n| 11th         | 2 or lower               | \n| 14th         | 3 or lower               | \n| 17th         | 4 or lower               | \n \n### Divine Intervention \n \nBeginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. \n \nImploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. \n \nIf your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. \n \nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.\r\n## Divine Domains\r\n### Life Domain\r\nThe Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy-one of the fundamental forces of the universe-that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei). \n \n**Life Domain Spells (table)** \n \n| Cleric Level | Spells                               | \n|--------------|--------------------------------------| \n| 1st          | bless, cure wounds                   | \n| 3rd          | lesser restoration, spiritual weapon | \n| 5th          | beacon of hope, revivify             | \n| 7th          | death ward, guardian of faith        | \n| 9th          | mass cure wounds, raise dead         | \n \n##### Bonus Proficiency \n \nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor. \n \n##### Disciple of Life \n \nAlso starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level. \n \n##### Channel Divinity: Preserve Life \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured. \n \nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct. \n \n##### Blessed Healer \n \nBeginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level. \n \n##### Divine Strike \n \nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. \n \n##### Supreme Healing \n \nStarting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"5e Core Rules\"\r\n",

You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic. \n \n### Spellcasting \n \nDrawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. \n \n### Wild Shape \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. \n \nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed. \n \n**Beast Shapes (table)** \n \n| Level | Max. CR | Limitations                 | Example     | \n|-------|---------|-----------------------------|-------------| \n| 2nd   | 1/4     | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf        | \n| 4th   | 1/2     | No flying speed             | Crocodile   | \n| 8th   | 1       | -                           | Giant eagle | \n \nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. \n \nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply: \n \n* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them. \n* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious. \n* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you've already cast. \n* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. \n* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. \n \n### Druid Circle \n \nAt 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Timeless Body \n \nStarting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. \n \n### Beast Spells \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components. \n \n### Archdruid \n \nAt 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. \n \nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.\r\n## Druid Circles\r\n### Circle of the Land\r\nThe Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites. \n \n##### Bonus Cantrip \n \nWhen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. \n \n##### Natural Recovery \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level \n(rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. \n \nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots. \n \n##### Circle Spells \n \nYour mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the associated list of spells. \n \nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. \n \n**Arctic (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                     | \n|-------------|-----------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | hold person, spike growth         | \n| 5th         | sleet storm, slow                 | \n| 7th         | freedom of movement, ice storm    | \n| 9th         | commune with nature, cone of cold | \n \n**Coast (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                      | \n|-------------|------------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | mirror image, misty step           | \n| 5th         | water breathing, water walk        | \n| 7th         | control water, freedom of movement | \n| 9th         | conjure elemental, scrying         | \n \n**Desert (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                                 | \n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | blur, silence                                 | \n| 5th         | create food and water, protection from energy | \n| 7th         | blight, hallucinatory terrain                 | \n| 9th         | insect plague, wall of stone                  | \n \n**Forest (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                    | \n|-------------|----------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | barkskin, spider climb           | \n| 5th         | call lightning, plant growth     | \n| 7th         | divination, freedom of movement  | \n| 9th         | commune with nature, tree stride | \n \n**Grassland (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                    | \n|-------------|----------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | invisibility, pass without trace | \n| 5th         | daylight, haste                  | \n| 7th         | divination, freedom of movement  | \n| 9th         | dream, insect plague             | \n \n**Mountain (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                   | \n|-------------|---------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | spider climb, spike growth      | \n| 5th         | lightning bolt, meld into stone | \n| 7th         | stone shape, stoneskin          | \n| 9th         | passwall, wall of stone         | \n \n**Swamp (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                        | \n|-------------|--------------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | acid arrow, darkness                 | \n| 5th         | water walk, stinking cloud           | \n| 7th         | freedom of movement, locate creature | \n| 9th         | insect plague, scrying               | \n \n##### Land's Stride \n \nStarting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. \n \nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* spell. \n \n##### Nature's Ward \n \nWhen you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease. \n \n##### Nature's Sanctuary \n \nWhen you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. \n \nThe creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. \n \n> ### Sacred Plants and Wood \n> \n> A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. \n> \n> Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. \n> \n> Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants. \n \n> ### Druids and the Gods \n> \n> Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"5e Core Rules\"\r\n",

Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. \n \n#### Archery \n \nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. \n \n#### Defense \n \nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. \n \n#### Dueling \n \nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. \n \n#### Great Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. \n \n#### Protection \n \nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. \n \n#### Two-Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. \n \n### Second Wind \n \nYou have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. \n \n### Action Surge \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn. \n \n### Martial Archetype \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \nThe number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class. \n \n### Indomitable \n \nBeginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. \n \nYou can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.\n \n### Martial Archetypes \n \nDifferent fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.\r\n## Martial Archetypes\r\n### Champion\r\nThe archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows. \n \n##### Improved Critical \n \nBeginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. \n \n##### Remarkable Athlete \n \nStarting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your proficiency bonus. \n \nIn addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier. \n \n##### Additional Fighting Style \n \nAt 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature. \n \n##### Superior Critical \n \nStarting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20. \n \n##### Survivor \n \nAt 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"5e Core Rules\"\r\n",

An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.\r\n**_Alignment._** Elves love freedom, variety, and self- expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos.

Your size is Medium.\r\n**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.\r\n**_Darkvision._** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n**_Keen Senses._** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.\n\n**_Fey Ancestry._** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.\n\n**_Trance._** Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.\nAfter resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.\r\n## Subtypes\r\n### High Elf\r\nAs a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.\r\n\r\n**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n**_Elf Weapon Training._** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.\n\n**_Cantrip._** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.\n\n**_Extra Language._** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"5e Core Rules\"\r\n",

Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.\r\n**_Lucky._** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.\n\n**_Brave._** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.\n\n**_Halfling Nimbleness._** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.\r\n## Subtypes\r\n### Lightfoot\r\nAs a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover.

Some are free-spirited and chaotic, letting impulse and fancy guide their decisions. Others are devoted to duty and personal honor. Typically, catfolk deem concepts such as good and evil as less important than freedom or their oaths.\r\n***Size.*** Catfolk have a similar stature to humans but are generally leaner and more muscular.

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n***Cat's Claws.*** Your sharp claws can cut with ease. Your claws are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with a claw, your claw deals slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\n\n***Hunter's Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception and Stealth skills.\r\n## Subtypes\r\n### Malkin\r\nIt's often said curiosity killed the cat, and this applies with equal frequency to catfolk. As a malkin catfolk you are adept at finding clever solutions to escape difficult situations, even (or perhaps especially) situations of your own making. Your diminutive size also gives you an uncanny nimbleness that helps you avoid the worst consequences of your intense inquisitiveness. Most often found in densely populated regions, these catfolk are as curious about the comings and goings of other humanoids as they are about natural or magical phenomena and artifacts. While malkins are sometimes referred to as \"housecats\" by other humanoids and even by other catfolk, doing so in a malkin's hearing is a surefire way to get a face full of claws...\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n***Curiously Clever.*** You have proficiency in the Investigation skill.\n\n***Charmed Curiosity.*** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for a Dexterity check or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.\r\n### Pantheran\r\nPantheran catfolk are a wise, observant, and patient people who pride themselves on being resourceful and self-sufficient. Less social than many others of their kind, these catfolk typically dwell in small, close-knit family groups in the forests, jungles, and grasslands of the world, away from larger population centers or cities. Their family clans teach the importance of living off of and protecting the natural world, and pantherans act swiftly and mercilessly when their forest homes are threatened by outside forces. Conversely, pantherans can be the most fierce and loyal of neighbors to villages who respect nature and who take from the land and forest no more than they need. As a pantheran, you value nature and kinship, and your allies know they can count on your wisdom and, when necessary, your claws.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n***Hunter's Charge.*** Once per turn, if you move at least 10 feet toward a target and hit it with a melee weapon attack in the same turn, you can use a bonus action to attack that creature with your Cat's Claws. You can use this trait a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n***One With the Wilds.*** You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Insight, Medicine, Nature, or Survival.\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"Tome of Heroes\"\r\n",

You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n***Hunger for Flesh.*** You must consume 1 pound of raw meat each day or suffer the effects of starvation. If you go 24 hours without such a meal, you gain one level of exhaustion. While you have any levels of exhaustion from this trait, you can't regain hit points or remove levels of exhaustion until you spend at least 1 hour consuming 10 pounds of raw meat.\n\n***Imperfect Undeath.*** You transitioned into undeath, but your transition was imperfect. Though you are a humanoid, you are susceptible to effects that target undead. You can regain hit points from spells like cure wounds, but you can also be affected by game effects that specifically target undead, such as a cleric's Turn Undead feature. Game effects that raise a creature from the dead work on you as normal, but they return you to life as a darakhul. A true resurrection or wish spell can restore you to life as a fully living member of your original race.\n\n***Powerful Jaw.*** Your heavy jaw is powerful enough to crush bones to powder. Your bite is a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\n\n***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.\n\n***Undead Resilience.*** You are infused with the dark energy of undeath, which frees you from some frailties that plague most creatures. You have resistance to necrotic damage and poison damage, you are immune to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or poisoned. When you finish a short rest, you can reduce your exhaustion level by 1, provided you have ingested at least 1 pound of raw meat in the last 24 hours (see Hunger for Flesh).\n\n***Undead Vitality.*** You don't need to breathe, and you don't sleep the way most creatures do. Instead, you enter a dormant state that resembles death, remaining semiconscious, for 6 hours a day. While dormant, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.\n\n***Heritage Subrace.*** You were something else before you became a darakhul. This heritage determines some of your traits. Choose one Heritage Subrace below and apply the listed traits.\r\n## Subtypes\r\n### Derro Heritage\r\nYour darakhul character was a derro before transforming into a darakhul. For you, the quieting of the otherworldly voices did not bring peace and tranquility. The impulses simply became more focused, and the desire to feast on flesh overwhelmed other urges. The darkness is still there; it just has a new, clearer form.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2.\r\n***Calculating Insanity.*** The insanity of your race was compressed into a cold, hard brilliance when you took on your darakhul form. These flashes of brilliance come to you at unexpected moments. You know the true strike cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it. You can cast true strike as a bonus action a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n### Dragonborn Heritage\r\nYour darakhul character was a dragonborn before transforming into a darakhul. The dark power of undeath overwhelmed your elemental nature, replacing it with the foul energy and strength of the undead. Occasionally, your draconic heritage echoes a peal of raw power through your form, but it is quickly converted into necrotic waves.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2.\r\n***Corrupted Bite.*** The inherent breath weapon of your draconic heritage is corrupted by the necrotic energy of your new darakhul form. Instead of forming a line or cone, your breath weapon now oozes out of your ghoulish maw. As a bonus action, you breathe necrotic energy onto your fangs and make one bite attack. If the attack hits, it deals extra necrotic damage equal to your level. You can't use this trait again until you finish a long rest.\r\n### Drow Heritage\r\nYour darakhul character was a drow before transforming into a darakhul. Your place within the highly regimented drow society doesn't feel that much different from your new place in the darakhul empires. But an uncertainty buzzes in your mind, and a hunger gnaws at your gut. You are now what you once hated and feared. Does it feel right, or is it something you fight against?\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2.\r\n***Poison Bite.*** When you hit with your bite attack, you can release venom into your foe. If you do, your bite deals an extra 1d6 poison damage. The damage increases to 3d6 at 11th level. After you release this venom into a creature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n### Dwarf Heritage\r\nYour darakhul character was a dwarf before transforming into a darakhul. The hum of the earth, the tranquility of the stone and the dust, drained from you as the darakhul fever overwhelmed your once-resilient body. The stone is still there, but its touch has gone from a welcome embrace to a cold grip of death. But it's all the same to you now. \r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdon score increases by 2.\r\n***Dwarven Stoutness.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.\r\n### Elf/Shadow Fey Heritage\r\nYour darakhul character was an elf or shadow fey (see *Midgard Heroes Handbook*) before transforming into a darakhul. The deathly power coursing through you reminds you of the lithe beauty and magic of your former body. If you just use your imagination, the blood tastes like wine once did. The smell of rotting flesh has the bouquet of wildflowers. The moss beneath the surface feels like the leaves of the forest.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.\r\n***Supernatural Senses.*** Your keen elven senses are honed even more by the power of undeath and the hunger within you. You can now smell when blood is in the air. You have proficiency in the Perception skill, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice or find a creature within 30 feet of you that doesn't have all of its hit points.\r\n### Gnome Heritage\r\nYour darakhul character was a gnome before transforming into a darakhul. The spark of magic that drove you before your transformation still burns inside of you, but now it is a constant ache instead of a source of creation and inspiration. This ache is twisted by your hunger, making you hunger for magic itself. \r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2.\r\n***Magical Hunger.*** When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to consume the spell's residual magic. Your consumption doesn't counter or otherwise affect the spell or the spellcaster. When you consume this residual magic, you gain temporary hit points (minimum of 1) equal to your Constitution modifier, and you can't use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n### Halfling Heritage\r\nYour darakhul character was a halfling before transforming into a darakhul. Everything you loved as a halfling—food, drink, exploration, adventure— still drives you in your undead form; it is simply a more ghoulish form of those pleasures now: raw flesh instead of stew, warm blood instead of cold mead. You still want to explore the dark corners of the world, but now you seek something different. \r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.\r\n***Ill Fortune.*** Your uncanny halfling luck has taken a dark turn since your conversion to an undead creature. When a creature rolls a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll against you, the creature must reroll the attack and use the new roll. If the second attack roll misses you, the attacking creature takes necrotic damage equal to twice your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).\r\n### Human/Half-Elf Heritage\r\nYour darakhul character was a human or half-elf before transforming into a darakhul. Where there was once light there is now darkness. Where there was once love there is now hunger. You know if the darkness and hunger become all-consuming, you are truly lost. But the powers of your new form are strangely comfortable. How much of your old self is still there, and what can this new form give you that your old one couldn't? \r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** One ability score of your choice, other than Constitution, increases by 2.\r\n***Versatility.*** The training and experience of your early years was not lost when you became a darakhul. You have proficiency in two skills and one tool of your choice.\r\n### Kobold Heritage\r\nYour darakhul character was a kobold before transforming into a darakhul. The dark, although it was often your home, generally held terrors that you needed to survive. Now you are the dark, and its pull on your soul is strong. You fight to keep a grip on the intellect and cunning that sustained you in your past life. Sometimes it is easy, but often the driving hunger inside you makes it hard to think as clearly as you once did.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2.\r\n***Devious Bite.*** When you hit a creature with your bite attack and you have advantage on the attack roll, your bite deals an extra 1d4 piercing damage.\r\n### Ravenfolk\r\nYour darakhul character was a ravenfolk (see Midgard Heroes Handbook) before transforming into a darakhul. Your new form feels different. It is more powerful and less fidgety, and your beak has become razor sharp. There is still room for trickery, of course. But with your new life comes a disconnection from the All Father. Does this loss gnaw at you like your new hunger or do you feel freed from the destiny of your people?\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.\r\n***Sudden Bite and Flight.*** If you surprise a creature during the first round of combat, you can make a bite attack as a bonus action. If it hits, you can immediately take the Dodge action as a reaction.\r\n### Tiefling Heritage\r\nYour darakhul character was a tiefling before transforming into a darakhul. You are no stranger to the pull of powerful forces raging through your blood. You have traded one dark pull for another, and this one seems much stronger. Is that a good feeling, or do you miss your old one?\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n***Necrotic Rebuke.*** When you are hit by a weapon attack, you can use a reaction to envelop the attacker in shadowy flames. The attacker takes necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), and it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.\r\n### Trollkin Heritage\r\nYour darakhul character was a trollkin (see *Midgard Heroes Handbook*) before transforming into a darakhul. Others saw you as a monster because of your ancestry. You became inured to the fearful looks and hurried exits of those around you. If only they could see you now. Does your new state make you seek revenge on them, or are you able to maintain your self-control despite the new urges you feel?\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2.\r\n***Regenerative Bite.*** The regenerative powers of your trollkin heritage are less potent than they were in life and need a little help. As an action, you can make a bite attack against a creature that isn't undead or a construct. On a hit, you regain hit points (minimum of 1) equal to half the amount of damage dealt. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"Tome of Heroes\"\r\n",

But no matter how well-trained and skilled you get in other magical or martial arts, the voices of your gods forever reverberate in your ears, driving you forward to do great or terrible things.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n***Insanity.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. In addition, you can read and understand Void Speech, but you can speak only a few words of the dangerous and maddening language—the words necessary for using the spells in your Mad Fervor trait.\n\n***Mad Fervor.*** The driving force behind your insanity has blessed you with a measure of its power. You know the vicious mockery cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the enthrall spell with this trait, and starting at 5th level, you can cast the fear spell with it. Once you cast a non-cantrip spell with this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. If you are using Deep Magic for 5th Edition, these spells are instead crushing curse, maddening whispers, and alone, respectively.\r\n### Mutated\r\nMost derro go through the process of indoctrination into their society and come out of it with visions and delusion, paranoia and mania. You, on the other hand, were not affected as much mentally as you were physically. The connection to the dark deities of your people made you stronger and gave you a physical manifestation of their gift that other derro look upon with envy and awe.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 1. \r\n***Athletic Training.*** You have proficiency in the Athletics skill, and you are proficient with two martial weapons of your choice.\n\n***Otherworldly Influence.*** Your close connection to the strange powers that your people worship has mutated your form. Choose one of the following:\n* **Alien Appendage.** You have a tentacle-like growth on your body. This tentacle is a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, your tentacle deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. This tentacle has a reach of 5 feet and can lift a number of pounds equal to double your Strength score. The tentacle can't wield weapons or shields or perform tasks that require manual precision, such as performing the somatic components of a spell, but it can perform simple tasks, such as opening an unlocked door or container, stowing or retrieving an object, or pouring the contents out of a vial.\n* **Tainted Blood.** Your blood is tainted by your connection with otherworldly entities. When you take piercing or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to force your blood to spray out of the wound. You and each creature within 5 feet of you take necrotic damage equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n* **Tenebrous Flesh.** Your skin is rubbery and tenebrous, granting you a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.\r\n### Uncorrupted\r\nSomeone in your past failed to do their job of driving you to the brink of insanity. It might have been a doting parent that decided to buck tradition. It might have been a touched seer who had visions of your future without the connections to the mad gods your people serve. It might have been a whole outcast community of derro rebels who refused to serve the madness of your ancestors. Whatever happened in your past, you are quite sane—or at least quite sane for a derro.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n***Psychic Barrier.*** Your time among your less sane brethren has inured you to their madness. You have resistance to psychic damage, and you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made against effects that inflict insanity, such as spells like contact other plane and symbol, and effects that cause short-term, long-term, or indefinite madness.\n\n***Studied Insight.*** You are skilled at discerning other creature's motives and intentions. You have proficiency in the Insight skill, and, if you study a creature for at least 1 minute, you have advantage on any initiative checks in combat against that creature for the next hour.\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"Tome of Heroes\"\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Planes\r\nThe cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well as myriad alternate dimensions of reality, called the **planes of existence**. It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.\n\nMany spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.\n\n## The Material Plane\n\nThe Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.\n\nThe worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.\n\n## Beyond the Material\n\nBeyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They're not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.\n\n## Planar Travel\n\nWhen adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.\n\nTravel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.\n\n**_Spells._** A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. _Plane shift_ and _gate_ can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. _Etherealness_ allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches-such as the Elemental Planes. And the _astral projection_ spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.\n\n**_Portals._** A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog- shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations- circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).\n\n## Transitive Planes\n\nThe Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as _etherealness_ and _astral projection_ allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.\n\nThe **Ethereal Plane** is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the _see invisibility_ and _true seeing_ spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as _forcecage_ and _wall of force_. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.\n\nThe **Astral Plane** is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.\n\n## Inner Planes\n\nThe Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four **Elemental Planes**-Air, Earth, Fire, and Water-form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning **Elemental Chaos**.\n\nAt their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form-great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.\n\n## Outer Planes\n\nIf the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.\n\nWhen discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally “places” at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.\n\nEven in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.\n\nDistance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.\n\nThe most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.\n\n### Outer Planes\n\nThe planes with some element of good in their nature are called the **Upper Planes**. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the **Lower Planes**. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't match the plane's experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.\n\n### Demiplanes\n\nDemiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don't seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as _demiplane_, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a _plane shift_ spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The _gate_ spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"5e Core Rules\"\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Diseases\r\nA plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.\n\nA simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of _lesser restoration_. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.\n\nA disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.\n\n## Sample Diseases\n\nThe diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.\n\n### Cackle Fever\n\nThis disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: “the shrieks.”\n\nSymptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until the disease is cured.\n\nAny event that causes the infected creature great stress-including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare-forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.\n\nAny humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.\n\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter.\n\n### Sewer Plague\n\nSewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.\n\nWhen a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.\n\nIt takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.\n\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.\n\n### Sight Rot\n\nThis painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.\n\nA beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as _lesser restoration_ or _heal_.\n\nSight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"5e Core Rules\"\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Madness\r\nIn a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.\n\n## Going Mad\n\nVarious magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as _contact other plane_ and _symbol_, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells*.* Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.\n\nResisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.\n\n## Madness Effects\n\nMadness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes.

      "rawPublic": "# Objects\r\nWhen characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire's coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character's success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.\n\nFor the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.\n\n## Statistics for Objects\n\nWhen time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.\n\n**_Armor Class_**. An object's Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.\n\n**Object Armor Class (table)**\n| Substance           | AC |\n|---------------------|----|\n| Cloth, paper, rope  | 11 |\n| Crystal, glass, ice | 13 |\n| Wood, bone          | 15 |\n| Stone               | 17 |\n| Iron, steel         | 19 |\n| Mithral             | 21 |\n| Adamantine          | 23 |\n\n**_Hit Points_**. An object's hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.\n\n**Object Hit Points (table)**\n\n| Size                                  | Fragile  | Resilient |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Tiny (bottle, lock)                   | 2 (1d4)  | 5 (2d4)   |\n| Small (chest, lute)                   | 3 (1d6)  | 10 (3d6)  |\n| Medium (barrel, chandelier)           | 4 (1d8)  | 18 (4d8)  |\n| Large (cart, 10-ft.-by-10-ft. window) | 5 (1d10) | 27 (5d10) |\n\n**_Huge and Gargantuan Objects_**. Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an _earthquake_ spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.\n\n**_Objects and Damage Types_**. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.\n\n**_Damage Threshold_**. Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points.\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"5e Core Rules\"\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Poisons\r\nGiven their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.\n\nPoisons come in the following four types.\n\n**_Contact_**. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.\n\n**_Ingested_**. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.\n\n**_Inhaled_**. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.\n\n**_Injury_**. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.\n\n**Poisons (table)**\n| Item               | Type     | Price per Dose |\n|--------------------|----------|----------------|\n| Assassin's blood   | Ingested | 150 gp         |\n| Burnt othur fumes  | Inhaled  | 500 gp         |\n| Crawler mucus      | Contact  | 200 gp         |\n| Drow poison        | Injury   | 200 gp         |\n| Essence of ether   | Inhaled  | 300 gp         |\n| Malice             | Inhaled  | 250 gp         |\n| Midnight tears     | Ingested | 1,500 gp       |\n| Oil of taggit      | Contact  | 400 gp         |\n| Pale tincture      | Ingested | 250 gp         |\n| Purple worm poison | Injury   | 2,000 gp       |\n| Serpent venom      | Injury   | 200 gp         |\n| Torpor             | Ingested | 600 gp         |\n| Truth serum        | Ingested | 150 gp         |\n| Wyvern poison      | Injury   | 1,200 gp       |\n\n## Sample Poisons\n\nEach type of poison has its own debilitating effects.\n\n **_Assassin's Blood (Ingested)_**. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned.\n\n **_Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled)_**. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes 3 (1d6) poison damage. After three successful saves, the poison ends.\n\n **_Crawler Mucus (Contact)_**. This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated crawler. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n **_Drow Poison (Injury)_**. This poison is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.\n\n **_Essence of Ether (Inhaled)_**. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.\n\n **_Malice (Inhaled)_**. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature is blinded.\n\n **_Midnight Tears (Ingested)_**. A creature that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n **_Oil of Taggit (Contact)_**. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage.\n\n **_Pale Tincture (Ingested)_**. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can't be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally.\n\n **_Purple Worm Poison (Injury)_**. This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated purple worm. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n **_Serpent Venom (Injury)_**. This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated giant poisonous snake. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n **_Torpor (Ingested)_**. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 4d6 hours. The poisoned creature is incapacitated.\n\n **_Truth Serum (Ingested)_**. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature can't knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a _zone of truth_ spell.\n\n **_Wyvern Poison (Injury)_**. This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated wyvern. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"5e Core Rules\"\r\n",
