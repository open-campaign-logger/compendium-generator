You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric-performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.\n\nChoose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.\r\n* Skill Profficiencies: Insight, Religion\r\n* Languages: Two of your choice\r\n* Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp\r\n## Shelter of the Faithful\r\nAs an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.\n\nYou might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.\r\n## Suggested Characteristics\r\nAcolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.\n\n**Suggested Acolyte Characteristics (table)**\n\n| d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                  |\n|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example.                  |\n| 2  | I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.      |\n| 3  | I see omens in every event and action.

You are an expert in complex social dynamics and knowledgeable in the history and customs of courtly life.

      "rawText": "# Destined\r\nDuty is a complicated, tangled affair, be it filial, political, or civil. Sometimes, there's wealth and intrigue involved, but more often than not, there's also obligation and responsibility. You are a person with just such a responsibility. This could involve a noble title, an arranged marriage, a family business you're expected to administer, or an inherited civil office. You promised to fulfill this responsibility, you are desperately trying to avoid this duty, or you might even be seeking the person intended to be at your side. Regardless of the reason, you're on the road, heading toward or away from your destiny.\n\n***Destiny***\nYou're a person who's running from something or hurtling headfirst towards something, but just what is it? The responsibility or event might be happily anticipated or simply dreaded; either way, you're committed to the path. Choose a destiny or roll a d8 and consult the table below.\n\n| d8 | Destiny                                                                                                                  |\n|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | You are running away from a marriage.                                                                                     |\n| 2  | You are seeking your runaway betrothed.                                                                                   |\n| 3  | You don't want to take over your famous family business.                                                                  |\n| 4  | You need to arrive at a religious site at a specific time to complete an event or prophecy.                               |\n| 5  | Your noble relative died, and you're required to take their vacant position.                                              |\n| 6  | You are the reincarnation of a famous figure, and you're expected to live in an isolated temple.                          |\n| 7  | You were supposed to serve an honorary but dangerous position in your people's military.                                  |\n| 8  | Members of your family have occupied a civil office (court scribe, sheriff, census official, or similar) for generations. |\r\n* Skill Profficiencies: History, Insight\r\n* Languages: One of your choice\r\n* Equipment: A dagger, quarterstaff, or spear, a set of traveler's clothes, a memento of your destiny (a keepsake from your betrothed, the seal of your destined office, your family signet ring, or similar), a belt pouch containing 15 gp\r\n## Reputation of Opportunity\r\nYour story precedes you, as does your quest to claim—or run away from—your destiny. Those in positions of power, such as nobles, bureaucrats, rich merchants, and even mercenaries and brigands, all look to either help or hinder you, based on what they think they may get out of it. They're always willing to meet with you briefly to see just how worthwhile such aid or interference might be. This might mean a traveler pays for your passage on a ferry, a generous benefactor covers your group's meals at a tavern, or a local governor invites your adventuring entourage to enjoy a night's stay in their guest quarters. However, the aid often includes an implied threat or request. Some might consider delaying you as long as politely possible, some might consider taking you prisoner for ransom or to do “what's best” for you, and others might decide to help you on your quest in exchange for some future assistance. You're never exactly sure of the associated “cost” of the person's aid until the moment arrives. In the meantime, the open road awaits.\r\n## Suggested Characteristics\r\nDestined characters might be running toward or away from destiny, but whatever the case, their destiny has shaped them. Think about the impact of your destiny on you and the kind of relationship you have with your destiny. Do you embrace it? Accept it as inevitable? Or do you fight it every step of the way?\n\n| d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                                            |\n|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | I'm eager to find this destiny and move on with the next stage in my life.                                                                   |\n| 2  | I keep the fire of my hope burning bright.

You expected to live all your days in the forest, at one with the green things of the world, until an unforeseen occurrence, traumatic or transformative, drove you from your familiar home and into the larger world. Civilization is strange to you, the open sky unfamiliar, and the bizarre ways of the so-called civilized world run counter to the truths of the natural world.\r\n* Skill Profficiencies: Nature, Survival\r\n* Languages: Sylvan\r\n* Equipment: A set of common clothes, a hunting trap, a wood staff, a whetstone, an explorer's pack, and a pouch containing 5 gp\r\n## Forester\r\nYour experience living, hunting, and foraging in the woods gives you a wealth of experience to draw upon when you are traveling within a forest. If you spend 1 hour observing, examining, and exploring your surroundings while in a forest, you are able to identify a safe location to rest. The area is protected from all but the most extreme elements and from the nonmagical native beasts of the forest. In addition, you are able to find sufficient kindling for a small fire throughout the night.\n\n ***Life-Changing Event***\nYou have lived a simple life deep in the sheltering boughs of the forest, be it as a trapper, farmer, or villager eking out a simple existence in the forest.
