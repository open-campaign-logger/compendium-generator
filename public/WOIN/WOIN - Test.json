It can also be used as a reference tool for people playing WOIN games. However, it is not a subsitute for the actual rulebooks, and lacks much of the descriptive or contextual text which accompanies the rules. For this reason, it may be difficult to learn the rules only using this document.\r\n\r\n## \r\n\r\nEquipment\r\n\r\nEquipment and starships are found separately on the [WOINGEAR website](http://www.woingear.com).\r\n",
