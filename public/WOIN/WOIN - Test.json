      "rawPublic": "# Creating Monsters\r\n\r\nThis creature design engine is a process by which you will be able to easily create a monster, creature, or generic NPC type. You can create anything from alien monstrosities to reusable NPC stat blocks such as ‚ÄúSoldier‚Äù or ‚ÄúPsionic Interrogator‚Äù\r\n\r\nMonsters and generic NPCs tend to be a bit more arbitrary than player characters. Of course, a monster can have whatever statistics you need - if you need your 3-foot alien furry bear to have STR 20 or 200 HEALTH for some reason, you can just assign those values. The following is just a set of guidelines to help your design process; feel free to ignore any of them.\r\n\r\nThis method is the reverse method to creating a character, because you are starting at your desired result and working backwards - you will know in advance that you want an 8d6 ‚Äúbrute‚Äù style robot, and this informs the rest of the creature‚Äôs statistics.\r\n\r\nOnce you have decided on your creature concept, following these steps.\r\n\r\nImportant! It is important to treat this process as a guide only. It is a tool to help you design creatures, but it is advisory only, not proscriptive. You can and should deviate from the figures below when it is thematically appropriate to do so.\r\n\r\nTry the Monster Builder\r\n\r\n## 1. Max Dice Pool (MDP)\r\n\r\nChoose your monster‚Äôs Maximum Dice Pool. This will decide many of the following statistics. You should start with an idea of how powerful you want your monster to be. For comparison, a starting character is 5d6, and a fire dragon is 15d6.\r\n\r\nPCs tend to be a little more optimised than monsters, so monster scores are slightly higher. Generally, a monster with +1 MDP over a PC is a challenging match which the PC should win. +2 MDP means the PC will probably lose one-on-one, and with +3 MDP the PC is almost certain to be defeated.\r\n\r\nThroughout this section, the term ‚ÄúMDP‚Äù means ‚ÄúMaximum Dice Pool‚Äù. Throughout this section, when you halve, quarter, or otherwise divide the MDP to derive a value, always round up.\r\n\r\n## 2. Role, Size, & Type\r\n\r\nChoose a ‚Äúrole‚Äù, a size category, and a type for your monster.\r\n\r\nThe role is just a broad descriptive tag which is not used in-game, but can be useful when designing. Choose from:\r\n\r\n- **Artillery.**¬† A creature which does area damage from a distance, such as a grenadier or a ranged heavy robot.\r\n- **Brute.**¬†A creature focuses on raw melee power, smashing its foes to the ground, such as a great ferocious beast or a mighty robot.\r\n- **Expert.**¬† A creature whose focus is not combat, such as a medic, engineer, or pilot.\r\n- **Ninja.**¬† A fast, mobile melee creature, able to attack quickly and accurately and dance around its opponents.\r\n- **Skirmisher.**¬† A fast, mobile, ranged creature, weak in melee, but able to keep its distance and pick off its targets from afar. Many gun-toting bandits are skirmishers.\r\n- **Support.**¬† A creature which heals or buffs other creatures, or alters the battlefield; this could be a specialist support robot, or an adept commander.\r\n- **Trickster.**¬†A frustrating opponent such as a teleporter, or psychic foe, able to inflict a range of conditions.\r\n\r\nThese names don‚Äôt really mean anything. They are descriptive tools during the design process, but you‚Äôll never need them again once the creature is finished.\r\n\r\nThe creature‚Äôs size uses the same scale as player characters, and includes tiny (mouse-sized), small (dog-sized), medium (human-sized), large (tiger-sized), enormous (elephant-sized), gigantic (whale-sized), colossal (kaiju-sized), and titanic .\r\n\r\nYou also need to know the creature‚Äôs type. This is an open-ended list which includes, but is not limited to, the following creature types: aquatic, avian, beast, changeling, crystalline, insectoid, humanoid, gaseous, mechanoid, plant, projection, and reptile. A creature can have more than one type, of course - it might be an avian mechanoid or a crystalline plant. The type will help determine some of the creature‚Äôs exploits, which you‚Äôll list at the end of this process.\r\n\r\nIts important to note that this is just an ‚Äúintroductory‚Äù list of creature types; you can no doubt imagine more exotic things like oozes and electricity monsters, and many more.\r\n\r\nUsing these details, note the monster‚Äôs descriptor, which is formed as follows:\r\n\r\n[size] [sentience] [types] (dice pool)\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nLarge semi-sentient mechanoid beast (7d6)\r\n\r\n## 3. Attributes\r\n\r\nA creature‚Äôs attributes depends on the monster‚Äôs role, which you chose in the previous step. Only give the creature a MAG/PSI/CHI score if you want it to have a supernatural ability. A creature‚Äôs REP score will help determine how much the player characters (and others) know about it. The creature‚Äôs mental statistics assume that the creature is sentient, but non-sentient, semi-sentient, and super-sentient creatures may radically alter these values in the next step.\r\n\r\n| Role | STR | AGI | END | INT | LOG | WIL | CHA | LUC | REP | SUP\\* |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Artillery | MDP 0.3 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.3 | MDP 0.6 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.2 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 |\r\n| Brute | MDP 0.6 | MDP 0.3 | MDP 0.6 | MDP 0.3 | MDP 0.3 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.3 | MDP 0.2 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.3 |\r\n| Expert | MDP 0.3 | MDP x 0.5 | MDP 0.3 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.6 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.3 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.6 |\r\n| Ninja | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.6 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.2 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.4 |\r\n| Skirmisher | MDP 0.3 | MDP x 0.5 | MDP 0.3 | MDP 0.6 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.3 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.2 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.4 |\r\n| Support | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.6 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.6 |\r\n| Trickster | MDP x 0.3 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.3 | MDP 0.6 | MDP 0.6 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.6 | MDP x 0.3 | MDP 0.5 | MDP 0.8 |\r\n\r\n\\*SUP refers to one of the three supernatural attributes: MAG, PSI, or CHI\r\n\r\n## 4. Sentience\r\n\r\nAlso consider the creature‚Äôs sentience.  Sentience typically comes in the following categories, and can alter the creature‚Äôs mental statistics in the following ways.\r\n\r\nNote that if you are giving a semi-sentient creature a 'career' (see below), it should be elevated to a sentient creature.\r\n\r\nNon-sentient.Non-sentient does not necessarily mean non-intelligent. Non-sentient creatures are immune to mental attacks.\r\n\r\nSemi-sentient. These are dogs, wolves, bears, and other animal-level intelligent creatures.  Semi-sentient creatures have 1-2 (1d6) LOG (carnivores are usually more intelligent than herbivores), and may often have INT attributes as high as their AGI attributes. INT represents senses, perception, and animal cunning.  Note that creatures known for specific senses (such as owls) can also have extremely high skill ranks in those specific abilities. CHA tends to be 1 (for ugly critters) or 2 (for attractive critters). WIL will tend to be around average (4) unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise.\r\n\r\nSentient.This includes most living sentient creatures with LOG attributes of 2 or more. Sentient creatures should be assigned mental attributes normally.\r\n\r\nSuper-sentient.Generally with LOG and INT attributes of 20 or more, these creatures are supra-geniuses far beyond even the greatest of humans. Super-sentient creatures automatically have the power of truesight, which enables them to see through illusions, invisibility, and disguises. They can also see in the dark, and through obscuring effects like smoke, although not through cover. Additionally, super-sentient creatures can automatically speak and understand any language.\r\n\r\n## 5. DEFENSES\r\n\r\nYou now need to determine the creature‚Äôs four DEFENSEs. Each DEFENSE is high, medium, or low, and is based on the monster‚Äôs MDP. The lowest a DEFENSE can be is 10.\r\n\r\nIf your monster doesn‚Äôt fit neatly into these categories, that‚Äôs fine (a dragon is a brute with some artillery traits, for example). Just pick the closest match and tweak it, or use entries from different roles. Remember, these are guidelines, not rules.\r\n\r\n| ROLE | MELEE | RANGED | MENTAL | VITAL |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Artillery | low | high | medium | low |\r\n|  | MDP x 2 | MDP x 4 | MDP x 3 | MDP x 2 |\r\n| Brute | high | low | low | high |\r\n|  | MDP x 4 | MDP x 2 | MDP x 2 | MDP x 4 |\r\n| Expert | low | medium | high | low MDP x 2 |\r\n|  | MDP x 2 | MDP x 3 | MDP x 4 |  |\r\n| Ninja | high | medium | low | medium |\r\n|  | MDP x 4 | MDP x 3 | MDP x 2 | MDP x 3 |\r\n| Skirmisher | low | high | medium | medium |\r\n|  | MDP x 2 | MDP x 4 | MDP x 3 | MDP x 3 |\r\n| Support | medium | medium | high | medium |\r\n|  | MDP x 3 | MDP x 3 | MDP x 4 | MDP x 3 |\r\n| Trickster | low | medium | high | low |\r\n|  | MDP x 2 | MDP x 3 | MDP x 4 | MDP x 2 |\r\n\r\n## 6. Size\r\n\r\nYou then need to adjust for SIZE (see the table below). While size can affect physical attributes, it does not necessarily correlate to them - a tiny, tiny tardigrade might have an END score many times higher than a human. STR, however, is an attribute you might consider capping by size; you don‚Äôt have to (after all, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with a tiny super-strong robot!) but a suggested cap is presented in the table below.\r\n\r\n| STATISTIC | Tiny | Small | Medium | Large | Enormous | Gigantic | Colossal | Titanic |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| MELEE DEFENSE | +4 | +2 |  | -2 | -4 | -8 | -16 | -16 |\r\n| RANGED DEFENSE | +4 | +2 |  |  | -8 | -16 | -32 | -32 |\r\n| VITAL DEFENSE | -2 | -2 |  | +2 | +4 | +6 | +8 | +16 |\r\n| ACTIONS | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\r\n| HEALTH | x1 | x1 | x1 | x1 | x1.5 | x2 | x3 | x5 |\r\n| REACH | 5' | 5' | 5' | 5' | 10' | 15' | 20' | 40' |\r\n| STR Cap | 1(106) | 3(206) | 10(406) | 15(5d6) | 21(606) | 45(906) | 78(1206) | 120+(15d6+) |\r\n\r\n## 7. SOAK\r\n\r\nMost creatures have a SOAK value. When you assign SOAK, you won‚Äôt necessarily know where that SOAK comes from - it may be from armor they are wearing, or from a tough hide, or thick fur, or a hard shell. You‚Äôll have a total amount of SOAK appropriate to the creature; you can describe it however you wish.\r\n\r\nLike before, you will be choosing from high, medium, and low SOAK. However, you should be very cautious about allowing SOAK scores above 20 -- the hardest substances in the core rules are diamond and duranium at SOAK 20 and tritanium and adamantium at SOAK 25. Unless you have a very compelling reason to do otherwise, you should cap the SOAK at 20.\r\n\r\n| ROLE | SOAK | HEALTH |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Artillery | low | low |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.5 | MDP x 3 |\r\n| Brute | high | high |\r\n|  | MDP x 2 | MDP x 10 |\r\n| Expert | low | low |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.5 | MDP x 3 |\r\n| Ninja | medium | medium |\r\n|  | MDP x 1 | MDP x 6 |\r\n| Skirmisher | low | low |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.5 | MDP x 3 |\r\n| Support | medium | medium |\r\n|  | MDP x 1 | MDP x 6 |\r\n| Trickster | low | low |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.5 | MDP x 3 |\r\n\r\n## 8. HEALTH\r\n\r\nHEALTH is an important value. As always, we choose from high, medium, and low, scores, and then we adjust for size. These values can be found in the same table as the SOAK table.\r\n\r\nSize affects HEALTH as follows: enormous x1.5, gigantic x2, colossal x3, and titanic x5.\r\n\r\nMonsters tend to have higher HEALTH than PCs. This abstracts the fact that they don‚Äôt have all the resources available that PCs have to heal and recover.\r\n\r\n## 9. INITIATIVE, PERCEPTION, & SPEED\r\n\r\nUsing the same method, determine your monster‚Äôs INITIATIVE, PERCEPTION, and SPEED scores.\r\n\r\n| Role | INITIATIVE | PERCEPTION | SPEED |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Artillery | medium | high | slow |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.75 | MDP x 1 | MDP x 0.5 |\r\n| Brute | low | low | slow |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.5 | MDP x 0.5 | MDP x 0.5 |\r\n| Expert | low | medium | medium |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.5 | MDP x 0.75 | MDP x 1 |\r\n| Ninja | high | medium | fast |\r\n|  | MDP x 1 | MDP x 0.75 | MDP x 1.5 |\r\n| Skirmisher | medium | high | fast |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.75 | MDP x 1 | MDP x 1.5 |\r\n| Support | medium | medium | medium |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.75 | MDP x 0.75 | MDP x 1 |\r\n| Trickster | high | high | fast |\r\n|  | MDP x 1 | MDP x 1 | MDP x 1.5 |\r\n\r\nYou will need to assign movement modes at this time. The listed SPEED is for the creature‚Äôs primary movement mode. For additional modes, it moves at half SPEED.\r\n\r\nIf a creature has a natural movement mode, it is denoted in the stat block with a ‚Äú+‚Äù symbol (e.g. CLIMB+ 8); this means that it does not need to make any attribute checks to move in this manner, and it uses the speed listed for the primary movement mode.\r\n\r\nIf the creature can fly, you should note whether or not it can hover by putting the word ‚Äúhover‚Äù in parenthesis after its FLY speed; if it cannot hover, it must move at least half its FLY speed each round to stay aloft.\r\n\r\n## 10. Attacks\r\n\r\nYou will need to determine the creature‚Äôs melee and ranged attack pools, plus an optional mental attack pool and psionic attack pool. Only include the latter two if they are relevant; the psionic attack pool, if it exists, is the same as the most thematically similar existing attack pool - most likely ranged (for something like a lightning bolt) or mental (for something like a psionic blast).\r\n\r\nMost creatures will only use their primary attack pool, but if a PC charges a ranged attacker, it might be forced to resort to its weaker attack mode.\r\n\r\nThe attack values in particular can be tweaked. If you want your brute to have a high ranged attack, go right ahead and assign it.\r\n\r\nYou might consider giving some creatures with a high single attack a secondary medium area attack. A dragon‚Äôs breath weapon would be a good example of this.\r\n\r\nDamage.Damage tracks with the attack pool, and is 50% of the attack pool. For example, an attack pool of 8d6 means 4d6 damage, while 7d6 would become 3d6+3. You will need to assign the damage type manually.\r\n\r\nRange.A ranged attack has a range in 5‚Äô squares of MDP x 1.5, unless the creature is a skirmisher or artillery, in which case the range is MDP x 2.\r\n\r\n| ROLE | MELEE ATTACK | RANGED ATTACK | MENTAL ATTACK |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Artillery | low | high | low |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.5 | MDP x 1 | MDP x 0.5 |\r\n| Brute | high | medium | low |\r\n|  | MDP x 1 | MDP X 0.75 | MDP x 0.5 |\r\n| Expert | low | low | medium |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.5 | MDP x 0.5 | MDP x 0.75 |\r\n| Ninja | high | low | low |\r\n|  | MDP x 1 | MDP x 0.5 | MDP x 0.5 |\r\n| Skirmisher | low | high | low |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.5 | MDP x 1 | MDP x 0.5 |\r\n| Support | medium | medium | medium |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.75 | MDP x 0.75 | MDP x 0.75 |\r\n| Trickster | low | medium | high |\r\n|  | MDP x 0.5 | MDP X 0.75 | MDP x 1 |\r\n\r\n## 11. Exploits\r\n\r\nYou now need to give the creature exploits. This is by far the most arbitrary part of the process. You should be inventive with its exploits - each creature should feel different. There‚Äôs a whole smorgasbord of area attacks, grabs, throws, mental attacks, psionic abilities, and more. Below is a small selection to get you started, but this is just the tip of the iceberg - it‚Äôs really important to note that this section is limited only by your imagination.\r\n\r\nFeel free to allow creatures to use exploits from other categories; these are listed thematically for convenience. Creatures and NPCs should also have access to regular exploits, and all have the ability to Aim or Feint.\r\n\r\nBelow, you will find a wide range of suggested exploits based on the creature's:\r\n\r\n- **Type**¬† (e.g. insectoid, avian, mechanoid)\r\n- **Role**¬† (e.g. brute, skirmisher, expert)\r\n- **Career**¬† (e.g. enchanter, knight, noble)\r\n\r\nYou should select from any or all of these exploits, or create new exploits of your own devising.\r\n\r\n## 11.1. Creature Type\r\n\r\nThe creature‚Äôs type(s) also grant it some exploits or other adjustments. Apply these now.\r\n\r\n- **Aquatic.**¬†The creature gains a SWIM speed equal to its regular SPEED. It can breathe underwater. Swimming is a natural movement mode for aquatic creatures.\r\n- **Avian**¬†. The creature gains a FLY speed equal to its regular SPEED. Flying is a natural movement mode for avians.\r\n- **Beast.**¬†These are normal animals such as dogs, bears, and dinosaurs.\r\n- **Changeling.**¬†A rare creature type, changelings are able to alter their shape and appearance. The exact details of this varies. They are typically immune to critical hits and conditions.\r\n- **Crystalline.**¬†Crystalline creatures are resistant to heat damage (SOAK 5 heat), but vulnerable (1d6) to sonic damage due to their brittle nature. They are immune to the Bleeding condition.\r\n- **Insectoid.**¬†Climbing is a natural movement mode for insectoids. The creature gains a CLIMB speed equal to its regular SPEED and does not need to make checks to climb. Such creatures can move on walls and ceilings normally.\r\n- **Humanoid.**¬†Humanoids gain no special advantages. They are bipedal, mammalian creatures.\r\n- **Gaseous.**¬†Gaseous creatures are immune to non energy-based physical attacks, and have SOAK 10 to energy-based attacks.\r\n- **Mechanoid.**¬†Mechanoids are immune to mental attacks, are vulnerable (1d6) to electricity damage, and vulnerable (2d6) to ion damage. They are usually immune to the Sick and Fatigued conditions.\r\n- **Plant.**¬†Plant creatures vulnerable (1d6) to fire, but have an additional 5 SOAK. Plants usually cannot wear armor. They are usually immune to the Sick and Fatigued conditions. They ignore natural difficult terrain, unless it is fire or heat-based.\r\n- **Projection.**¬†Projections are incorporeal entities, including psychic entities and holograms. Projections are incorporeal. This makes them immune to physical weapons unless they do psionic damage (in the case of a psychic entity) or ion damage (in the case of a hologram); they can pass through physical barriers. A projection will usually do psionic or electricity damage, if it does any damage. Projections cannot usually be killed; reducing them to 0 HEALTH simply disperses them for a while. Projections can freely fly, although many do not. Projections have superior darksight and lifesense to a distance of 5' per point of INT. Projections are usually immune to any physical conditions.\r\n- **Reptile.**¬†Reptiles are cold-blooded and are vulnerable (1d6) to cold damage. They usually have scales granting +5 natural SOAK.\r\n- **Swarm.**¬†A swarm is a collection of thousands of tiny creatures which attack en masse. A swarm is immune to all attacks except for area attacks. When it attacks, it simply moves into the target's square. Any creature which starts its turn in or enters the swarm's square suffers melee damage automatically, and may suffer the Blind condition. Swarms can move through gaps of any size.\r\n\r\n## 11.2. Role\r\n\r\nBelow is a selection of suggested exploits based on the creature's role.\r\n\r\nArtillery\r\n\r\n- **Burst.**¬† This attack does burst damage (in a Burst equal to half MDP, so artillery with MDP 8 does a Burst 4). The attack attacks all creatures within the burst area (make only one attack roll and only one damage roll and apply it to all targets in the area). A psi-cop unleashes a psionic blast or soldier fires a grenade launcher.\r\n- **Cone.**¬† Alternatively, the artillery could unleash a half MDP cone such as a breath weapon or flamethrower.\r\n\r\nBrute\r\n\r\n- **Stop Right There!**¬†Enemies which try to move past the brute (move within reach) are subject to a free action attack, which stops their movement if successful.\r\n- **Charge.**¬† The brute moves its SPEED and makes an attack with one action.\r\n- **Burst.**¬†The brute uses an action to attack all adjacent targets. On a hit they are pushed back 10‚Äô.\r\n- **Cone.**¬†Alternatively, this could be a cone such as a tail swipe.\r\n- **Grab.**¬†This attack inflicts the Restrained condition on a creature, and requires a melee attack to escape. The brute‚Äôs natural damage is automatically inflicted at the start of the grabbed creature‚Äôs turns.\r\n- **Hurl.**¬†Send a creature flying 3 squares plus one square per size difference and, do natural damage; this attack inflicts Downed condition.\r\n- **Roar.**¬†This burst attack with a Burst equal to the brute‚Äôs MDP does a mental attack which inflicts the Afraid condition.\r\n- **Trample.**¬†The brute can move through a smaller creature‚Äôs square, getting a free melee attack which knocks the target aside and prone for the attacker‚Äôs natural damage. If the attack misses, the brute must stop its movement.\r\n- **Monstrous Leap.**¬†The brute leaps into the air a height of 5‚Äô per MDP, making an attack against one foe it can reach while doing so.\r\n- **Quake.**¬†The brute slams a foot, fist, or tail on the ground, shaking the area within its aura. The brute makes an attack against everybody within the area, knocking targets prone and doing 1d6 damage to them.\r\n- **Monumental.**¬† The brute has double SOAK against ranged weapons.\r\n- **Living Shield.**¬† The brute picks up another creature smaller than itself and uses it as a shield. The target can escape the grab as normal. Until then, the brute gains the protection of a shield of the same size category (e.g. a medium-sized creature is a medium shield). Additionally, attacks which miss but would have hit had the shield not been in place hit the grabbed creature instead.\r\n- **Come Here!**¬† A target struck with a weapon or tentacle with a range equal to half its regular ranged attack range is pulled adjacent to the brute. The target cannot be larger than the brute.\r\n\r\nExpert\r\n\r\n- **Skill dice.**¬†The expert‚Äôs primary skill dice pool is its MDP. It could be piloting, medicine, engineering, heraldry, or any other area of expertise.\r\n- **Analyze.**¬†For one round the expert can remove one enemy‚Äôs SOAK. This only works on a given target once.\r\n- **Healing.**¬†The expert can heal allies with an action equal to their damage roll. Each can only benefit once.\r\n\r\nNinja\r\n\r\n- **Third attack.**¬†If the ninja makes two melee attacks, it gets a third attack for free.\r\n- **Achilles heel.**¬†The ninja can bypass SOAK once per foe.\r\n- **Dart In.**¬†The ninja moves its SPEED, attacks, then moves its SPEED back again.\r\n- **Stealthy.**¬†The ninja can make MDP stealth checks to remain effectively invisible.\r\n- **Teleport.**¬†The ninja can move a double move as one action. A psionic ninja teleports, special forces use transporter tech, a super-fast race zooms to a new location, or an alien simply makes a giant leap.\r\n- **Poison.**¬†This attack inflicts the Poisoned or Sick conditions.\r\n\r\nSkirmisher\r\n\r\n- **Perfect aim.**¬† The skirmisher gets +2d6 from aiming instead of +1d6.\r\n- **Mobile attack.**¬† The skirmisher moves two moves and make a single ranged attack at any point.\r\n- **Dive For Cover.**¬†On a missed attack, the skirmisher may use a reaction to move its SPEED and either get prone or behind cover.\r\n- B**ackpedal.**¬†When someone attempts a melee attack, the skirmisher use a reaction to step back 10‚Äô and take a shot.\r\n- **Panicked Unload.**¬† The skirmisher fires two shots at a target and if both hit, it gains a third shot.\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n\r\n- **Healing.**¬† The support NPC can heal allies with an action an amount of HEALTH equal to their damage roll. Each can only benefit once.\r\n- **Leadership.**¬†The support has a dice pool equal to its MDP to donate to its allies; it must declare this before any dice are rolled.\r\n- **Designate target.**¬† The support chooses one target. That target may not benefit from cover until another target is selected. A spotlight illuminates the target or a commander uses a tactical battlefield targeting drone.\r\n- **Battlefield control.**¬† The support can create difficult terrain or darkness in a burst area radius equal to its MDP. An ice cannon creates an icy patch, or an engineer throws caltrops\r\n- **Summon.**¬† The support can summon, create, or activate activate 1d6 mooks. An engineer activates some security droids, or a commander summons some ninjas.\r\n\r\nTrickster\r\n\r\n- **Teleport.**¬†The trickster can move a double move as one action, bypassing any obstacles.\r\n- **Deceive.**¬†An illusion of self disguises the trickster‚Äôs true location.\r\n- **Controller.**¬† A mental attack makes the target Charmed.\r\n- **Taunt.**¬† A mental attack makes the target Angry.\r\n\r\nGeneral/Unusual\r\n\r\n- **Aura.**¬†An aura equal to half the creature‚Äôs MDP does low damage or inflicts a condition.\r\n- **Berserker.**¬†The creature gains +1d6 damage when below half HEALTH; it cannot stop attacking until all foes are dead.\r\n- **Called Shot.**¬†The creature has a weakness which can be exploited via a Called Shot (-2d6 to hit). This might inflict a condition, or even kill it outright.\r\n- **Disease**¬†. The creature inflicts a disease on a critical hit.\r\n- **Poison**¬†. The creature inflicts the Poisoned condition on a hit.\r\n- **Regeneration.**¬†The creature automatically heals a quarter MDP HEALTH at the start of each turn.\r\n\r\nRemember, this is just a small selection of ideas. You should try to vary your creatures as much as possible and design your own exploits.\r\n\r\n## 11.3. Careers\r\n\r\nYou can create goblin assassins, orc shamans, and fire dragon enchanters. The following exploits, attacks, and adjustments are suggestions in addition to the role-based exploit suggestions above. As always, you should feel free to arbitraily change anything to fit the concept you are building.\r\n\r\n1. A career often adds +1d6 or more to the creature‚Äôs Maximum Dice Pool.\r\n2. The creature gains +4 HEALTH, and an additional +4 HEALTH for each size category above medium, and +2 to each DEFENSE.\r\n3. The creature gains a career-relevant attack (noted below, along with a relevant icon).\r\n4. The creature gains an attribute increase to a relevant (noted) attribute if it does not have that attribute score or higher already.\r\n5. An attack or check directly related to the creature‚Äôs career (e.g. an archer firing an arrow, a firemage throwing a firebolt, or an enchanter controlling his victim‚Äôs mind) always uses the creature‚Äôs Maximum Dice Pool for the roll, even if the stat block would otherwise indicate something less. The creature‚Äôs career is the thing it is best at.\r\n6. It's not necessary to define career-specific skills because the MDP will always be used for such actions, although you should assume that the creature has 6 (3d6) in any relevant skill, unless it already has a higher score.\r\n\r\n### Alchemist \r\n\r\n- LOG increases to 10 (4d6) if it not at least that already.\r\n- The alchemist uses its Maximum Dice Pool to throw grenades.\r\n- üÖ°**Grenade.**¬† The alchemist can throw a grenade with a range increment of 6, using its Maximum Dice Pool, which inflicts one of the following conditions: sticky fire (Burning), sonic boom (Deaf), glue (Restrained) or cold (Slowed).\r\n\r\n### Archer \r\n\r\n- INT increases to 10 (4d6) if it not at least that already.\r\n- The archer uses its Maximum Dice Pool to fire arrows.\r\n- üÖ° **Skirmish**¬†.

Any creature which enters or starts its turn in the blizzard takes 1d6 cold damage. The area becomes difficult terrain. The blizzard moves with the icemage.\r\n- Additionally, by touching the ground, the icemage creates a 30' diameter slick ice sheet centered on itself. It can walk on the sheet normally, but for everybody else it is difficult terrain.\r\n- üÖ° **Icebolt.**¬†The icemage can make a ranged attack with an increment of 5 which does 3d6 cold damage\r\n\r\n### Illusionist\r\n\r\n- LOG increases to 10 (4d6) if it not at least that already.\r\n- The illusionist uses its Maximum Dice Pool to cast spells.\r\n- Once per day the illusionist can turn invisible at-will as a free action for one minute.\r\n- The illusionist can create illusions up to 10‚Äô by 10‚Äô; an INT check vs. the illusionist‚Äôs MDP times 4 is required to see through it.\r\n- üÖû **Illusionary attack.**¬†The illusionist can make a mental attack against a target within 30' which does 3d6 psychic damage.\r\n\r\n### Investigator\r\n\r\n- INT increases to 10 (4d6) if it not at least that already.\r\n- The investigator uses its Maximum Dice Pool to perceive, track, and detect.\r\n- The investigator can detect magic within 10'.\r\n- üÖû **Intimidate.**¬†The investigator can inflict the Placid condition with a mental attack against a target within 30'.\r\n\r\n### Knight\r\n\r\n- WIL increases to 10 (4d6) if it not at least that already.\r\n- The knight uses its Maximum Dice Pool to attack in melee.\r\n- The knight automatically succeeds in attempts to shake off the Afraid condition.\r\n- The knight can inspire its allies with a single action, and grant all allies within 30‚Äô +1d6 to attack rolls until the end of their next turn.\r\n- üÖú **Smite.**¬†The knight can focus all its actions into one attack which does double damage.\r\n\r\n### Loremaster\r\n\r\n- LOG increases to 10 (4d6) if it not at least that already.\r\n- The loremaster uses its Maximum Dice Pool for knowledge-related checks.\r\n- üÖû **Baffling speech.**¬† The loremaster can make a mental attack against a single foe within 30' which inflicts the Confused condition.\r\n\r\n### Minstrel \r\n\r\n- CHA increases to 10 (4d6) if it not at least that already.\r\n- The minstrel uses its Maximum Dice Pool to cast spells via song.\r\n- üÖû **Word of sleep.**¬†The minstrel can inflict the Sleeping condition on all within 60‚Äô with a CHA mental attack by spending two actions and singing a lullaby.\r\n\r\n### Musketeer\r\n\r\n- AGI increases to 10 (4d6) if it not at least that already.\r\n- The musketeer uses its Maximum Dice Pool to use firearms.\r\n- üÖ° **Whites of their eyes**¬†.

Rangers can use a mental attack against semi-sentient non-magical creatures (animals) within 30' which inflicts the Placid condition.\r\n\r\n### Shaman\r\n\r\n- MAG increases to 10 (4d6) if it not at least that already.\r\n- The shaman uses its Maximum Dice Pool to cast spells.\r\n- Shamans can touch‚Äîand harm‚Äîincorporeal creatures such as spirits as though they were corporeal.\r\n- A shaman has a spirit animal which grants them +1d6 when performing related attribute checks. Choose from Bear (STR), Panther (AGI), or Wolf (INT).\r\n- üÖû**Hex.**¬†The shaman can hex its foes. The target of the shaman‚Äôs  hex must be within 30'. If the mental attack (7d6) is successful, the target suffers a -1d6 die penalty to all checks for the next five minutes. This is cumulative; if multiple hexes reduce the target to a zero maximum dice pool, it falls into a coma until the hex expires.\r\n\r\n## 11.4. Animals & Careers\r\n\r\nYou can give an animal a career, creating polar bear illusionists, velociraptor pirates, even a shark druid. This also grants it an increase in LOG to 4 (if the career doesn't already grant a higher LOG score), and changes it to sentient.\r\n\r\n## 12. Skills\r\n\r\nYou will also need the monster‚Äôs skills. While most of the time you will just be using its derived statistics, occasionally you may need something more specific. These can be assigned arbitrarily. Here are some to consider:\r\n\r\n- combat skill\\*- the monster equivalent of unarmed combat is simply called combat.\r\n- perception- this may be named after the creature‚Äôs special senses, such as scent, hearing, etc., or it may just be called perception.\r\n- movement skill\\*- this may be running or some similar skill.\r\n- tactics or reactions - the monster should have one of these two skills.\r\n- social skill(s)\\*- this optional skill, especially for tricksters and supporters, might includebluffing, intimidation, persuasion, and so on.\r\n- stealth - most creatures will have this at some level, even if it is very low.\r\n- psionic/magical skill(s)\\* - assign these if relevant, but most supernatural powers will be in the form of easy-to-use exploits.\r\n- carrying - four-legged herbivores, and similar creatures, often have a dice pool in carrying equal to half their Maximum Dice Pool.\r\n\r\nYou should manually assign relevant skills. Remember that creatures can be naturally muchtter than humans at certain things, especially when it comes to senses, movement, and fighting. Don't be afraid to give them 10 or more ranks in something. If in doubt, compare them to an exceptional human (a professional athlete, for example), who would have 10 ranks or so. If the creature would be better than a trained athlete at a skill, then give it 10 or more ranks.\r\n\r\nIf in doubt, just give a creature a skill dice pool of half its Maximum Dice Pool.\r\n\r\n## 13. Finishing Up\r\n\r\nFinally, you will need to finish up with the minor (or not so minor!) details. You should feel free to tweak any values on the stat block - if your NPC is from a race of speedsters who only move at light speed, go ahead and give it a SPEED of 100, or whatever is appropriate. If your creature is reflective and immune to heat weapons, go ahead and add that immunity. Remember, as the GM, the monster is exactly what you need it to be.\r\n\r\nIf you are publishing the creature, it‚Äôs probably worth encoding those arbitrary changes as exploits, just so that others can see clearly where they came from, but this is not vital. And if you are only using it in your home game, it really doesn‚Äôt matter!\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Eras of Play\r\n\r\nThe core rules of What‚Äôs OLD is NEW deal with three broad eras. While these can be broken down into numerous smaller ages, this is not necessary to play the game.\r\n\r\nEach of the three standalone books, O.L.D., N.O.W., and N.E.W., presents a single era in detail.\r\n\r\nArchaic.  This era covers the stone age, all the way through medieval times, up to the rennaissance and introduction of early firearms. It features swords, elves, and dragons.  It is covered in detail in [O.L.D.](https://enpublishingrpg.com/collections/whats-old-is-new-woin/products/o-l-d-the-fantasy-heroic-roleplaying-game-v1-2) which focuses on medieval fantasy.\r\n\r\nModern. This era broadly covers the 20th and early 21st century. It features martial arts action heroes, tricked out vehicles, superspies, and ninjas. It is covered in detail in [N.O.W.](https://enpublishingrpg.com/collections/whats-old-is-new-woin/products/n-o-w-the-modern-action-roleplaying-game-v1-2) which focuses on 80s-style contemporary action.\r\n\r\nFuture.  This era covers anything beyond the present day. It features starships, laser swords, blasters, and psionics.  It is covered in detail in [N.E.W.](https://enpublishingrpg.com/collections/whats-old-is-new-woin/products/n-e-w-the-science-fiction-roleplaying-game-v1-2) which focuses on galactic exploration, colonization, and conflict.\r\n\r\nA game setting can be based on one of these three eras, or it can mix and match to put wizards on starships.  In terms of what technology to include, the default rule (unless the setting says otherwise) is that any technology from an earlier era is available in a later era at double the price, and that technology from a later era is not available in a previous era.  These items are designated archaic, modern, and future in this rules reference document.\r\n\r\nThe three supernatural elements - magic, chi, and psionics, can each be included in any of these eras.\r\n\r\n# \r\n\r\nAdvancement Level\r\n\r\n## 0. Stone Age\r\n\r\nSpears, axes, basic tools.\r\n\r\n### 0.5. Bronze Age\r\n\r\nIrrigation, chariots, bronze weapons, shields, ancient history.\r\n\r\n## 1. Iron Age\r\n\r\nSwords, metal tools.\r\n\r\n## 2. Medieval Age\r\n\r\nWindmills, horseshoes, crop rotation, compasses, crossbows.\r\n\r\n## 3. Renaissance Age\r\n\r\nMuskets, clocks, telescopes, lenses, printing press.\r\n\r\n## 4. Industrial Age\r\n\r\nEarly automobiles.\r\n\r\n### 4.5 Information Age\r\n\r\nEarly computers, car phones, jets.\r\n\r\n## 5. Digital Age\r\n\r\nElectronics, computers, satellites, automobiles, aircraft, nuclear weapons\r\n\r\n### 5.5. Quantum Age\r\n\r\nFlying cars, internal electronics, super computers.\r\n\r\n## 6. Fusion Age\r\n\r\nInvisible wearable tech, genetic engineering, solar system colonization.\r\n\r\n## 7. Energy Age\r\n\r\nEnergy weapons, nearby star systems explored.\r\n\r\n## 8. Superluminal Age\r\n\r\nEarly FTL travel; burgeoning multi-system government.\r\n\r\n## 9. Stellar Age\r\n\r\nAdvanced FTL travel; galactic exploration; thousands of colonies; transporters.\r\n\r\n## 10. Galactic Age\r\n\r\nVery advanced FTL; dyson spheres and ringworlds; full galactic colonization; basic time travel.\r\n\r\n## 11. High Galactic Age\r\n\r\nMultiple galaxies colonized and explored.\r\n\r\n## 12. Universal Age\r\n\r\nAdvanced time travel; black hole power systems; universal colonization.\r\n\r\n## 13. High Universal Age\r\n\r\nAbility to restructure or move entire galaxies; control of dark matter.\r\n\r\n## 14. Dark Energy Age\r\n\r\nCan survive, prevent, or cause the end of the universe; manipulation of dark energy.\r\n\r\n## 15.

For a more heroic feel, the GM can opt to use Cinematic Mode.\r\n\r\n- In Cinematic Mode, characters and creatures add a LUC dice pool when calculating their total Health. Lucky characters can be very resilient, if sometimes accidentally so.\r\n- Adult characters also gain an additional LUC die, and old characters gain a further LUC die, representing experience.\r\n- Additionally, when in cinematic mode, you ignore the skill requirement for using higher quality equipment; anybody can benefit from superior gear.\r\n\r\nCinematic Mode may be especially appropriate for space opera or high fantasy settings.\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# The Game\r\n\r\nWhat‚Äôs OLD is NEW is a flexible game system which focuses on three genres: traditional fantasy, explosive modern action, and futuristic sci-fi. It is supported by a wide range of sourcebooks, worlds, and adventures.\r\n\r\n## The System\r\n\r\nWhat's OLD is NEW uses a [d6 dice pool system](/rules-of-the-game/dice-pools) vs. a difficulty benchmark.  The game only uses d6s.\r\n\r\nCharacters are created using a [life-path system](/characters).  After choosing a [heritage](/characters/heritages), players choose an [origin](/characters/origins) career, followed by four further [careers](/characters/careers).  Each adds to [attributes](/characters/attributes) and [skills](/characters/skills), and grants specific exploits.\r\n\r\nWOIN also features freeform magic, vehicle combat, starship combat,  martial arts & chi, psionics & mutants, stronghold building, and more.\r\n\r\n## Which Genre?\r\n\r\nThe rules in this rules reference document are compatible with medieval fantasy, contemporary action, and future sci-fi, but may not be thematically suitable for all settings and campaigns.  A game using only medieval fantasy rules will not use the Warp Maneuver exploit.\r\n\r\nThis rules reference document, however, presents rules from all three genres of play.  The skills list, therefore, includes skills from herbalism to astrophysics, and the exploits list contains exploits from Counterspelling to Wingovers. Similarly, the race sections contain all options from all three genres, from mountain dwarves to mutants to androids.\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Environment\r\n\r\nAdventurers can‚Äôt always rely on the fact that they‚Äôll be in a comfortable, temperate environment. Deserts, volcano bases, mountaintops, howling storms, blizzards, driving rain, underwater lairs, and more can contrive to create a wide array of environments and can make for extremely memorable set-piece battles.\r\n\r\nThe following environmental templates can be applied to areas the size of a world or as small as part of a room.\r\n\r\nEnvironments sometimes inflict a persistent condition, such as Sick or Fatigued, which only wears off after a night‚Äôs sleep. If a condition mentions that it applies after an hour, it is considered a persistent condition.\r\n\r\nAreas can have more than one environmental type. For example, an arctic wasteland might be cold and windy.\r\n\r\nSome creatures are immune to certain environments. SOAK 5 (or more) of an appropriate damage type (where relevant) makes a creature immune to a condition. Some abilities or exploits may also provide condition immunity.\r\n\r\nAn environment doesn‚Äôt typically inflict actual damage. Anything in the environment that‚Äôs dangerous enough to inflict damage (such as an actual fire, lava pit, pool of acid, liquid nitrogen, etc.) is a hazard and can do direct damage to those who touch it. Environments do not have such extreme effects, can typically be traversed, but may have effects if characters spend too long in them.\r\n\r\nEnvironment types have the following characteristics.\r\n\r\n## Acidic\r\n\r\nAcidic environments can be caused by acid rain or chemical smoke. An acidic environment causes irritation and pain. Those who spend more than an hour in an acidic environment suffer the Pained condition.\r\n\r\n## Cold\r\n\r\nFrom arctic wastelands to ice dragon lairs, cold environments can be debilitating and deadly. After an hour, cold environments inflict the Slow condition due to sluggish reactions and slowing metabolisms. Note that 5 points of cold SOAK, such as that from protective gear, protects from cold.\r\n\r\n## Difficult Terrain\r\n\r\nSnow, mud, rubble, debris, swamp, shallow water, deep undergrowth, and more can create difficult terrain. Difficult terrain halves ground movement SPEED.\r\n\r\n## Dim/Smoky/Rain/Snow\r\n\r\nDim light, obviously caused by a lack of light, can also represent smoky, snowy, or raining environments where vision is compromised. Dim light renders a creature which starts its turn in the area Blind (although this does not progress beyond the first stage); darker areas inflict the severe Blind condition automatically unless the creature has some way of illuminating the area or seeing in the dark. Unlike other environmental effects, this wears off as soon as the environmental effect goes away.\r\n\r\n## Hot\r\n\r\nFrom hot volcanic ninja lairs to burning warehouses, a hot environment is an environment similar to that of a desert; somewhere in the region of 100+ degrees Fahrenheit (or 45 degrees Celsius). It causes Fatigue after an hour. A scorching environment is significantly hotter, and burns those within it; those who begin their turn in a scorching area gain the Burning condition.\r\n\r\n## Radioactive\r\n\r\nRadioactive areas are very dangerous. Those who begin their turn in a radioactive area gain the Sick condition. Those who spend an hour in the area contract radiation sickness (see the section on illnesses and diseases).\r\n\r\n## Slippery\r\n\r\nA slippery area, caused by things like icy ground or an oil slick, counts as difficult terrain (half SPEED).\r\n\r\n## Thick/Thin Atmosphere\r\n\r\nWhile both thick and thin atmospheres are very dissimilar, their effects on creatures are not so different. Both types of atmosphere can quickly tire a creature not used to it; after an hour, creatures gain the Fatigued condition.\r\n\r\n## Tremors\r\n\r\nUnstable environments could be caused by earthquakes, sailing ships under extreme fire, or buildings about to explode. Tremors count as difficult terrain (half SPEED). At the start of each round, all creatures must make a Routine [10] AGI check or fall prone. Quakes make for an extremely difficult environment‚Äîhorizontal movement is counted as climbing‚Äîand the AGI check is Difficult [16] and additionally inflicts 2d6 blunt damage on a failure (as well as knocking the creature prone).\r\n\r\n## Underwater\r\n\r\nAn underwater environment eliminates all fire-based effects, reduces fire damage from weapons and spells by ‚Äì1d6, increases electricity damage by +1d6, and counts as difficult terrain. It is also airless (see suffocation, under thick/thin atmospheres).\r\n\r\n## Vacuum\r\n\r\nA vacuum is an area with no atmosphere. It is a myth that vacuums cause spontaneous explosion of human tissue, although exposure is certainly not healthy.\r\n\r\nThe biggest danger from a vacuum is simply the lack of air. Without some way to breathe, living creatures in a vacuum will quickly suffocate. Lack of oxygen uses a similar process to that when an unconscious character is dying. Create a countdown dice pool equal in size to the character‚Äôs END attribute. Each turn, the dice pool is rolled and any 6s rolled are removed from the pool. When the final die is removed, the character falls unconscious and the unconscious and dying process begins as normal.\r\n\r\n## Wet\r\n\r\nA wet environment is a humid or rainy one‚Äîtropical jungles, aboard a sailing ship, in driving rain. In these environments, the Burning condition has no effect and fire-based weapons cannot cause critical hits.\r\n\r\n## Windy\r\n\r\nWindy environments are caused by rushing air (or other gases). Wind always has a direction of movement, which is determined beforehand. Moving into the wind counts as difficult terrain. In a hurricane, it is harder‚Äî to move into the wind, a Challenging [13] STR check is required. Additionally, at the start of every turn, all creatures must make a Challenging [13] STR check or be pushed 1d6 squares in the direction of the wind.\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Objects\r\n\r\nAn object's statistics are based on its size and its composition. These two pieces of information are all that is needed to determine an inanimate object's DEFENSE, HEALTH, and SOAK.\r\n\r\n## HEALTH\r\n\r\nThe health of an object is simply the square root of its weight in pounds (if known). If the exact weight is not known, use the average figures below. An object is broken when reduced to half HEALTH and destroyed when reduced to zero. This does not apply to creatures or characters, whose HEALTH is based on other attributes.\r\n\r\n## DEFENSE\r\n\r\nAn object's DEFENSE is based on its size.\r\n\r\n## SOAK\r\n\r\nAn object's SOAK is based on the material it is made of. If an object is made of multiple materials, simply pick the most prevalent.\r\n\r\n## Reinforced Objects\r\n\r\nReinforced objects have double the normal HEALTH.\r\n\r\n## Ray Shielding\r\n\r\nRay-shielded objects gain +10 SOAK vs. energy damage.\r\n\r\n## Fireproofed\r\n\r\nFireproofed objects gain +10 SOAK vs. heat damage.\r\n\r\n## Spellproofed\r\n\r\nSpellproofed objects gain +10 SOAK vs. magical damage (defined as any type of damage produced by magic). Already magic-resistant materials like feysilver cannot be further spellproofed.\r\n\r\n## Larger Objects\r\n\r\nObjects of 1,000 tons or more (about 2,000,000 lb) are considered Class I objects, and use the Starship Hull Scale.\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Vehicle Combat\r\n\r\nSometimes characters will engage in combat from aboard a vehicle; this may involve vehicles fighting each other, or pedestrians fighting against or with vehicles. Vehicles follow the following rules when involved in a combat situation.\r\n\r\nVehicles are placed on the battlemap, and usually take up two or more squares (motorcycles only take up one square). A vehicle‚Äôs stats indicate the number of occupants (including the driver) it may carry.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle is essentially an extension of its driver. It acts on the driver‚Äôs Initiative, and moves on the driver‚Äôs turn. Other occupants act on their own turns, as normal. However, passengers move for free automatically with the vehicle, as you would expect.\r\n\r\n## Initiative\r\n\r\nThe driver rolls Initiative as normal. The vehicle‚Äôs Handling score provides a bonus or penalty to the driver‚Äôs Initiative roll.\r\n\r\n| Handling |\r\n| --- |\r\n| 1 |\r\n| 2 |\r\n| 3 |\r\n| 4 |\r\n| 5 |\r\n| 6 |\r\n\r\n## Movement\r\n\r\nA vehicle moves forward on its driver‚Äôs turn. The driver spends one of their actions driving the vehicle. The passengers do not need to spend actions to move, as they move for free with the vehicle.\r\n\r\nA vehicle moves its current velocity; on the driver‚Äôs turn, as part of his driving action, they may increase or decrease the vehicle‚Äôs velocity by an amount up to its Acceleration score. For example, if the vehicle is moving at Speed 10, and has an Accel of 3, they may brake and reduce the Speed to 7, or they may put theirs foot down and increase it to 13. The vehicle cannot move faster than the Speed score listed in its stat block.\r\n\r\n## Turning\r\n\r\nThe driver may turn the vehicle. They may alter its course by up to 45 degrees. Every vehicle has a turning circle which indicates how many squares it must move forward before making a turn; as long as the vehicle follows this rule, leaving the requisite amount of squares between turns of up to 45 degrees, it may turn as often in a round as the driver wishes.\r\n\r\nA vehicle‚Äôs turning circle is equal to its current speed multiplied by its Handling, divided by 5 (round down to a minimum of 1). A Handling 3 car moving at a velocity of 6 has a turning circle of (3 x 6) √∑ 5 = 3. A smaller Handling 1 motorcycle moving at the same velocity has a turning circle of just 1 hex, while a Handling 5 truck at that speed has a turning circle of 6.\r\n\r\n## Actions\r\n\r\nThe occupants of a vehicle can act as normal. They may shoot with handheld weapons normally, or they can use vehicle-mounted weapons (using the gunnery skill); or, of course, they can take any other action they are capable of.\r\n\r\nThe driver must use one of their actions moving the vehicle (unless it is stationary); they can use their  remaining action as they wish. However, any action taken while driving suffers a -2d6 complication penalty.\r\n\r\n## Firing Weapons\r\n\r\nWeapons can be operated by vehicle occupants. Weapons have a firing arc, unless they are turreted, granting a 360-degree firing arc. Line of sight is required unless the weapon is designated Artillery. Some weapons are linked, which means one occupant fires both at the same time.\r\n\r\nAn occupant uses Agility or Intuition to fire (as normal), and applies the usual range increment penalties. Attacks are made against the target vehicle‚Äôs Defense; vehicles add their current speed to their Defense score, making fast-moving vehicles harder to hit.\r\n\r\nWeapon damage is reduced by a vehicle‚Äôs SOAK and then applied to its HEALTH.\r\n\r\n### Vehicle Movement Modifiers to Hit\r\n\r\n| Situation |\r\n| --- |\r\n| Stationary target |\r\n| Rear attack |\r\n\r\nForward-mounted weapons +1d6\r\n\r\n| Per range increment |\r\n| --- |\r\n| Aft-mounted weapons |\r\n\r\nShooting at occupants. If a vehicle‚Äôs occupant is targeted by a weapon, the occupant gains the benefit of the vehicle‚Äôs Soak score or his own Soak score, whichever is higher, and uses his own Ranged Defense score or the vehicle‚Äôs (whichever is higher‚Äîremember, the vehicle adds its current speed to its Defense score). Occupants also have cover (‚Äì2d6 to hit) unless they are on a motorcycle or other open vehicle.\r\n\r\n## Critical hits\r\n\r\nCritical hits work slightly differently when a vehicle is the target. Roll on the following table when a critical hit is scored.\r\n\r\n| 2d6 |\r\n| --- |\r\n| 2 |\r\n| 3 |\r\n| 4 |\r\n| 5 |\r\n| 6 |\r\n| 7 |\r\n| 8 |\r\n| 9 |\r\n| 10 |\r\n| 11 |\r\n| 12 |\r\n\r\n## Collisions\r\n\r\nThere are four types of collisions: head-on, rear-end, T‚Äëbone, and sideswipe. When a collision takes place, all vehicles spin out unless the driver makes a successful check (see below). Both vehicles take damage equal to three times the collision speed:\r\n\r\n- **Head-on.**¬†Two vehicles collide and each is in the other‚Äôs front arc. Add their current speeds together.\r\n- **Rear-end.**¬† A vehicle collides with the rear arc of another vehicle. Deduct the black vehicle‚Äôs speed from the red vehicle‚Äôs speed.\r\n- **T-bone.**¬† A vehicle collides with the side arc of another vehicle. Use the speed of the red car.\r\n- **Sideswipe.**¬† The result of a maneuver in which two vehicles collide with the side arcs of each other. Use half of the faster vehicle‚Äôs speed.\r\n\r\n## Spinning Out\r\n\r\nSpinning out occurs when:\r\n\r\n1. The driver is injured.\r\n\r\n2. A tire is damaged.\r\n\r\n3. A collision takes place.\r\n\r\n4. The vehicle enters or begins its turn on slippery terrain (oil slicks, ice, etc.)\r\n\r\n5. After a jump.\r\n\r\nThe driver may attempt to prevent the vehicle from spinning out by making an AGI check (bolstered by their driving skill, if they have it) with a difficulty equal to three times the vehicle‚Äôs current speed.\r\n\r\nIf the vehicle spins out, it comes to a stop in a randomly determined square half its current speed from the point where it span out. Also roll 1d6; on a roll of 5, it ends up on its side, and on a 6 it ends up upside down.\r\n\r\nA vehicle which spins out causes 1d6 damage to all occupants. This damage cannot be SOAKed.\r\n\r\n## Stunts\r\n\r\nA number of maneuvers are available as exploits, including emergency stop, handbrake turn (J-turn), and more. The driver may use his action to perform these exploits.\r\n\r\nAll vehicles can attempt a jump as long as a ramp is present. The vehicle jumps as part of its Speed (it cannot accelerate or decelerate while airborne), but the maximum distance it can jump is equal to its half its current speed divided by its Handling (round down). For example, a generic compact automobile moving at Speed 12 with Handling 3 can jump 2 squares, while a motorcycle moving at Speed 18 with Handling 1 can jump 9 squares.\r\n\r\nJumping is one thing, however. Landing is another. A vehicle automatically spins out (see above) when it lands after a jump, unless the driver is able to prevent it from doing so.\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Countdowns\r\n\r\nA countdown takes place when there is an unknown time limit before something occurs. It is used in the following situations:\r\n\r\n- **Death.**¬†An unconscious character uses the countdown mechanic as he slips towards death.\r\n- **Illness.**¬†Disease and illness use the countdown mechanic as symptoms worsen.\r\n- **Drowning or suffocation**¬†. Characters who cannot breath (underwater, or some other reason) use the countdown mechanic to determine when they lose consciousness.\r\n- **Starship explosions**¬†. In N.E.W., badly damaged starships use a countdown pool to determine when they explode; hopefully the heroes can escape the ship before it does!\r\n- **Other ticking clocks**¬†.There are many other situations where a ticking clock is relevant. Occasions where you need a tense situation as a character tries to do something before something else happens are ideal for it. Can a climber scale a crumbling cliff before it collapses? Can a thief pick a lock before the magical alarms go off? Can a Smallfolk burglar recover the magic goblet and escape the dragon's lair before it wakes up?\r\n\r\nThe countdown is started by forming a dice pool. Different situations will determine the size of that dice pool ‚Äì a dying character uses one equal in size to his ENDURANCE dice pool, for example, while cliffs or magical alarms will have their dice pool size set by the GM. The larger the dice pool, the longer you ‚Äì probably! - have.\r\n\r\nEach turn, the dice pool is rolled. Usually it's rolled by the player in question ‚Äì she rolls her own death dice, or her own drowning dice.\r\n\r\nAny dice which comes up with a six is removed from the dice pool, and play continues.\r\n\r\nEventually the last dice will be removed from the dice pool. It is then that the character dies, the trap explodes, or the soldier looks in the crate.\r\n\r\n## Fast, Medium, And Slow Countdowns\r\n\r\nThe default countdown‚Äîremoving a dice on a roll of 6‚Äîis a slow countdown. Countdowns can run down faster than this, however. For faster countdowns, dice are removed on rolls of 5‚Äì6, or even 4‚Äì6.\r\n\r\nA countdown is always expressed in terms of a fast, medium, or slow countdown. The default countdown (if not specified) is a slow countdown expiring on rolls of 6.\r\n\r\n- Fast (4-6)\r\n- Medium (5-6)\r\n- Slow (6)\r\n\r\n## Stabilizing and Replenishing Countdowns\r\n\r\nSome countdowns can be stabilized or replenished. A stabilized countdown simply stops counting down‚Äî the trap has been disarmed in time, or the character is no longer in danger of dying.\r\n\r\nReplenishing a countdown allows extra dice to be added, effectively extending it. In this way, illnesses can be pushed back ‚Äúup‚Äù the countdown and dying characters can be stabilized with emergency healing.\r\n\r\nNot all countdowns can be stabilized or replenished; the specific countdown will clearly indicate whether or not these are appropriate. Sometimes the cliff is going to crumble whatever you do‚Äîit‚Äôs just a question of whether you get to the top before that happens!\r\n\r\n## Countdowns and Stages\r\n\r\nMost countdowns are fairly simple‚Äîthe dice pool is rolled until it reaches zero, at which point an effect (death, explosion, and so on) takes place. However, some countdowns have effects which take place at various stages throughout the process. Stages take place as the dice pool reaches certain sizes. For example, an illness might have a character becoming blind when the pool reaches two dice, and dying when it reaches zero dice. All countdowns technically have two stages‚Äîthe starting condition and the ending condition.\r\n\r\n## Average Countdown Length\r\n\r\nThe table below shows the expected (average) number of rolls a countdown will last for before expiry. This can be used by the GM to set appropriate countdown dice pools. Note, however, that countdown pools can be very 'swingy' and a large pool might still deplete quickly while a small one might take longer.\r\n\r\n| Dice Pool |\r\n| --- |\r\n| 1d6 |\r\n| 2d6 |\r\n| 3d6 |\r\n| 4d6 |\r\n| 5d6 |\r\n| 6d6 |\r\n| 7d6 |\r\n| 8d6 |\r\n| 9d6 |\r\n| 10d6 |\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Dice Pools\r\n\r\n## Core Mechanic\r\n\r\nThe core resolution mechanic of the game is a dice pool based attribute check. Actions, including attacks, are performed by making attribute checks.  To make an attribute check, form a dice pool and attempt to beat a difficulty benchmark set by the GM.\r\n\r\n## Maximum Dice Pool\r\n\r\nThe maximum dice pool that a character can form is based on their grade.  A starting character can form a dice pool of up to 5d6. Additional grades add to this maximum pool size.\r\n\r\nTry the Dice Pool Calculator\r\n\r\n## Attribute Checks\r\n\r\nDice pools are formed using attributes, skills, and equipment. You can only use one attribute pool, one skill pool, and one equipment pool.\r\n\r\nAdd the dice pool from an attribute plus any skill to form an attribute check.\r\n\r\nFor example, to climb a wall you might add 3d6 from AGILITY and 2d6 from climbing to form a 5d6 dice pool.\r\n\r\n## Equipment\r\n\r\nEquipment quality contributes to the dice pool as follows.\r\n\r\nStandard equipment simply allows you to perform an action normally.  If basic equipment is not available, improvised equipment inflicts a -2d6 penalty.\r\n\r\nThe number of dice that equipment contributes to a dice pool can never exceed the number of dice tha skills contribute to it; you need a certain degree of expertise to fully benefit from higher quality equipment. If the equipment dice exceed the skill dice, reduce the equipment dice to equal the skill dice.\r\n\r\nThis includes armor (skill in light, medium, heavy, or powered), weapons (skills in swords, bows, rifles, staves, pistols, etc.), and general equipment for which an associated skill might be relevant (skill in meteorology when using ship's sensors to analyse an atmospheric fluctuation, for example).\r\n\r\n## Group Checks\r\n\r\nWhen a group check is called for, every PC makes a check and the check succeeds if more PCs succeed than fail (i.e. half or more of the PCs succeed). It is assumed that stronger PCs are helping weaker ones, and weaker PCs are hindering stronger ones in a group check.\r\n\r\n## Aiding\r\n\r\nWhen characters aid one another, add together their base attributes and determine the resultant dice pool of the total. The GM will decide if, and how many characters can contribute - for example, only two people at a time might be able to break down a door.\r\n\r\nFor example, a character with STR 6 (3d6) aided by another character with STR 6 (3d6) combine to form an attribute of 12 (4d6).\r\n\r\n## Optional Rule: Gearmasters\r\n\r\nTo make the game more equipment focused rather than attribute and skill focused, in Cinematic Mode the dice pool maximum can optionally be applied only to attributes + skills. Gear quality may be added on top after capping, in the same way that exploits can. This changes the flavor of the game and makes the acquisition of high quality equipment a more central part. This will also increase dice pool sizes, and make characters generally more powerful.\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# LUCK\r\n\r\nLUCK is a special attribute. It is used as a replenishable resource which can modify other die rolls and perform special actions. It represents luck, fate, chance, destiny faith, divine favor, karma, and more. Luck can be interpreted in any way by characters and creatures who use it. For some, it is merely coincidence and serendipity; for others it represents cool and mojo; while for still others it may be divine in origin, representing faith and blessings. However the character interprets the concept of luck, it is used in the same way.\r\n\r\nEach player should form a LUCK dice pool.  As dice are used from the LUCK pool, simply discard them.  LUCK can be used to:\r\n\r\n1. Add dice to any attribute check on a 1:1 basis.\r\n2. Deduct dice from someone else's attribute check on a 1:1 basis.\r\n3. Absorb damage on a 1:1 basis (roll as many LUC dice as you wish, and deduct the total from the damage).\r\n4. Add dice to a damage roll on a 1:1 basis.\r\n5. Gain one bonus action per turn by spending a LUC die. This can only happen during a character‚Äôs own turn.\r\n6. Ignore an inflicted temporary condition as a reaction to the effect which causes it.\r\n7. Perform other special actions granted by careers and exploits.\r\n\r\nLUC dice can only be used within an encounter; you cannot use LUC dice during downtime, or on daily checks. And the GM should disallow the use of LUC if she feels that a player is simply blowing all their LUCk on a check because it‚Äôs the only one they‚Äôll make that day. In game terms, being able to invest all your LUC in one go makes sense only if you‚Äôve had, or will have, a number of other chances to be unlucky in the day (you‚Äôve either saved up a lucky moment or will have a chance to ‚Äúpay it back‚Äù).\r\n\r\n## Exploding Dice\r\n\r\nLUCK dice \"explode\".  This means that whenever a 6 is rolled, the die is rolled again and the new roll added to the original 6.  This process is repeated if subsequent 6s are rolled. It is recommended that LUCK dice be a different color to other dice so that they can be easily distinguished.\r\n\r\n## Leadership\r\n\r\nThe Leadership exploit allows you to donate your LUC dice to others. Without this exploit, you may only spend LUC on yourself. Characters with the Leadership exploit may donate one or more of their available LUC dice to another character as a free reaction to their attempting an attribute check. You must declare this before the ally rolls their check.\r\n\r\n## Replenishing LUCK\r\n\r\nOnce per day, a character may replenish his LUCK pool. Some careers or traditions allow for an additional replenishment; these do not stack, and you cannot gain more than one additional daily replenishment.\r\n\r\n## Other Uses of LUCK\r\n\r\nOther uses of LUCK manipulate situations where the odds are normally even.\r\n\r\n1. When determining a 50/50 chance of an outcome, roll a Routine [10] LUCK check instead.  Characters with higher LUCK succeed more often on an ostensibly 50/50 chance.\r\n2. When randomly determining a PC, have each player roll LUCK.  Either the highest or the lowest wins, depending on the situation.\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Movement\r\n\r\nMovement is a vital part of any combat encounter. Any creature can use one action to move up to its SPEED. A creature‚Äôs SPEED indicates the number of 5-foot increments (squares) it can move in one action (it also indicates its normal speed in miles-per-hour).\r\n\r\nSPEED is the total of the raw dice pool of STRENGTH and AGILITY plus one relevant skill.  Movement skills include (but are not limited to) running, climbing, swimming, flying, and zero-g.\r\n\r\n- **Movement methods.**¬†For non-primary movement methods, the movement rate is halved.  For most characters, this means that walking/running is at the full rate, and climbing, swimming, zero-g, etc. are at half rate (after adding the bonus from the skill).  Some exploits may grant a full movement rate.  Some creatures (such as birds) may have a different primary movement mode, and walk/run at half speed. A skill cannot turn a movement method into a primary method; only an exploit can do that.\r\n- **Hustling**¬†. A character who moves with two actions in a turn is ‚Äúhustling,‚Äù and effectively moving at twice its normal speed. Creatures with more than two actions available may not move more than twice in a turn. An Olympic sprinter typically has a SPEED of 10 or more, and is using both actions to run, resulting in movement in the range of 20 miles per hour.\r\n- **Difficult terrain.**¬†Difficult terrain (deep snow, swamp, ice, high or low gravity, etc.) halves ground movement rates. Some exploits may allow full movement rates on one or more difficult terrain types.\r\n- **Vehicles.**¬†A vehicle's SPEED is also its maximum speed in tens of miles per hour. A vehicle with a SPEED of 12 has a maximum speed of 120mph.\r\n- **Diagonal movement.**¬† If a square grid is being used, a diagonal movement counts as 5‚Äô, but creatures may not move diagonally around a corner.\r\n- **Climbing and balancing.**¬† Climbing is an AGI check. A successful check allows the climber to move at her climb speed up a vertical surface. The climber need only make one check per turn‚Äîthis check applies to all climbing movement in that turn. Balancing on a narrow ledge or beam is a form of climbing. A failed check simply means that the character cannot climb the wall or object. She may attempt another check next turn. A high quality climbing kit can assist with climbing. The surface determines the difficulty of the climb.\r\n\r\n| Surface |\r\n| --- |\r\n| Cliff, rough, many handholds |\r\n| Brick or stone wall, few handholds |\r\n| Ice or smooth metal |\r\n| Overhand or ceiling |\r\n| Narrow ledge or plank |\r\n| Tightrope |\r\n\r\nFighting while climbing. Fighting while hanging from a wall is difficult. A non-climber attacking a climber gains a +2d6 bonus to the attack. A climber attacking a nonclimber suffers a ‚Äì2d6 penalty. If both combatants are climbing, nobody gets any bonuses or penalties.\r\n\r\nCreatures with primary climbing modes. If a creature has climbing as a natural movement mode, it simply moves its Speed along walls and ceilings with no checks requires or combat checks imposed.\r\n\r\nFalling. Characters who fall from a height take 1d6 damage for every 10‚Äô fallen. (Falls of less than 10‚Äô do not cause damage.) Any fall results in the character landing prone unless an AGI check with a difficulty value equal to the number of feet fallen is made (this represents an attempt to reduce falling damage by jumping down; see below).\r\n\r\nJumping. Every character and creature has a ‚Äúfree‚Äù Jump allowance noted on its character sheet or stat block. This is a distance that the character may make a running jump without making any check at all; it simply happens automatically (for a standing jump, simply half the values). A jump counts as one action.\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

Any character can attempt to use alchemy in order to solve a problem or achieve a goal. Alchemy often involves at least a touch of magic. As an extended skill task, alchemy is used for more mundane chemical purposes. Examples of mundane uses of alchemy include:\r\n\r\n- Removing a permanent condition.\r\n- Melting a lock with acid.\r\n- Treating a disease.\r\n- Create a strong glue.\r\n- Creating a poison or an antidote (for poisons, an opposed task is needed vs. the target‚Äôs Defense, assuming the poison can be delivered in food or drink; it does 2d6 poison damage plus 1d6 for each complexity level used, which means that the longer you spend making a poison, the more deadly it is).\r\n- Burn or combust materials like metal and stone.\r\n\r\nLike herbs, alchemical concoctions can also be used to inflict conditions, thus creating a love potion or a sleep draught. The concoction must be delivered (imbibed by the target, or similar). A concoction which is eaten or drunk is an hourly task, a poultice, salve, or ointment is a daily task, and a gas, incense, or smoke is a weekly task.\r\n\r\nThe traditional, legendary uses of alchemy (transforming lead into gold, or creating an elixir of immortality) are covered in the magic rules.\r\n\r\nIf the concoction needs a duration (such as an antidote that will protect the imbiber from a certain poison), the duration equals one time increment of the extended task. Characters can choose to increase the tasks‚Äôs complexity (say, from hourly to daily) in order to gain a longer duration.\r\n\r\nThe check is a simple opposed one vs. the target‚Äôs Defense or Mental Defense, and success inflicts a condition, with a critical success inflicting a severe condition.\r\n\r\nThe players start by declaring their intentions. This goal may be anything they wish, although they may find some goals too hard to accomplish. It might be to devise an acid to melt the lock on a cell door, save an ally who has been turned to stone by a gorgon, or build an explosive. The GM sets the difficulty as normal, and characters may attempt LOGIC checks until they have reached the target number of successes (typically three successes). The complexity and duration of the task are established as normal. Alchemy is a classic example of a very simple use of the extended task mechanism.\r\n\r\nAlchemy is an acceptable way to accomplish many tasks, even if other methods are available. A locked door can be picked or hacked by a burglar, or an alchemist might attempt to open it by melting the lock with alchemical acid. The difficulty of the task does not change‚Äîif it‚Äôs a Difficult [16] task to pick the lock, then it‚Äôs a Difficult [16] alchemical task also.\r\n\r\n## Poison Crafting\r\n\r\n| Time |\r\n| --- |\r\n| 1 minute |\r\n| 1 hour |\r\n| 1 day |\r\n| 1 week |\r\n| 1 month |\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

The first to reach six wins is the winner of a chase situation (although the GM can modify this for longer or shorter chases). Multiple people can be involved in a chase, each making their own checks.\r\n\r\nA simple foot chase simply involves STR or AGI checks, along with the running skill. A vehicle chase may instead use AGI and driving, or a starfighter chase may use AGI and piloting.\r\n\r\nA more complex chase involves other skills. The target chooses the action (they might elect to climb a wall, dive into an asteroid field, jump a canyon, and so on), and the pursuers must match it. Examples of actions can be seen below.\r\n\r\n### Foot chases\r\n\r\n- Climb a wall (climbing vs. climbing)\r\n- Jump an alleyway (jumping vs. jumping)\r\n- Disappear into a crowd (stealth vs. perception)\r\n- Swim a river (swimming vs. swimming)\r\n- Squeeze through a tight gap (acrobatics vs. acrobatics)\r\n- Balance along a narrow ledge (acrobatics or climbing)\r\n- Use a hidden shortcut (local knowledge vs perception)\r\n- Cause a distraction (bluff vs. perception)\r\n- Cause an obstruction or obstacle (varies)\r\n- Duck into a blind alley (stealth vs. perception)\r\n- Get somebody to give the pursuers false directions (bluffing vs. local knowledge)\r\n\r\n### Vehicle chases\r\n\r\n- Jump a canyon (driving vs. driving)\r\n- Fly though a twisting canyon (piloting vs. piloting)\r\n- ‚ÄúSki‚Äù a vehicle through a narrow gap (driving vs. driving)\r\n\r\n### Space chases\r\n\r\n- Dive into an asteroid field (piloting vs. piloting)\r\n- Hide in a nebula (stealth vs. computers)\r\n\r\n## Speed\r\n\r\nDifferent characters, creatures, vehicles, and ships have different speeds. While skill is the most important factor, speed is also very important. Anybody involved in a race or a chase can add +1d6 to their checks if they have a Speed of 10 or more, and +2d6 if they have a Speed of 20 or more.\r\n\r\n## Random Terrain\r\n\r\nOne way to adjudicate a chase is to randomly determine terrain and obstacles at each stage. Some basic examples using 2d6 can be seen below, although you are encouraged to devise your own tables tailored to your setting. Each obstacle gives the participants opportunity to devise how to use or circumvent them.\r\n\r\nYou may allow a PC an automatic win if they have a way to circumvent an obstacle which their opponent lacks‚Äî a PC with a jet pack automatically succeeds at crossing a canyon, for example.\r\n\r\n| 2d6 |\r\n| --- |\r\n| 2 |\r\n| 3 |\r\n| 4 |\r\n| 5 |\r\n| 6 |\r\n| 7 |\r\n| 8 |\r\n| 9 |\r\n| 10 |\r\n| 11 |\r\n| 12 |\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Interrogations\r\n\r\nCommon skills: interrogation, bluffing, intimidation, persuasion, seduction.\r\n\r\nAn interrogation is an opposed extended task. The goal is to extract information from a subject. Unlike many extended tasks, an interrogation can continue indefinitely. However, each time a questioner loses an opposed check, the task complexity increases from quick to hourly to daily, and so on, meaning that the time required gets longer and longer.\r\n\r\nA simple interrogation involves CHA vs. WIL checks, along with the interrogation skill. That skill is used to both conduct and withstand interrogation. Each time the interrogator makes a check, they ask a question. If they win the opposed check, the subject answers truthfully; if they fail, the subject lies or refuses to answer, and the complexity of the task incceases by one stage.\r\n\r\nThe answer can be no more than a short sentence ‚Äì the interrogator can‚Äôt ask ‚ÄúWhatis your entire plan, in full detail?‚Äù The GMshould hide the subject‚Äôs die rolls; theinterrogator does not know if the subjectis lying (unless they have a relevant psionic power or an interrogation kit).\r\n\r\nIn modern or future settings, interrogation kits indicate when a subject is lying (although the subject may make an opposed CHA vs. INT check, using the bluffing skill if they have it, to deceive the interrogation kit), as well as granting possible bonuses to checks. Some drugs can also obviate the need for an interrogation, or prevent the subject from lying. Of course, a subject cannot reveal information they do not have.\r\n\r\nEach use of an interrogation kit causes 1d6 damage to the subject.\r\n\r\nMore advanced interrogations may use other skills, including persuasion, bluffing, even seduction.\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Scanning\r\n\r\nCommon skills: computers, medicine, chemistry, biology, mining.\r\n\r\nUsing a scanner is a simple, single-check task. Characters can use a hand-held scanner to obtain information about a target or the surroundings. All scanners operate in a similar way, although starship sensors (which are essentially giant scanner arrays with immense range) are dealt with in more detail [here](/space/sensors). Basic use of a scanner uses the computers skill, but subject-specific skills like medicine or chemistry can also be used to reveal detailed information.\r\n\r\nWhen operating a scanner, the character may ask one closed question which the GM will answer. The question must fall within the equipment‚Äôs area of focus (a medical scanner can‚Äôt detect mineral deposits, and a mining scanner can‚Äôt diagnose an illness, for example), but other than that any question may be asked. Each question is one use of the scanner, and takes one action.\r\n\r\nTo use a scanner, make a Routine [10] LOG check. Scanners have a 10‚Äô range increment, much like a weapon‚Äôs range increment; each increment inflicts a -1d6 die penalty to the dice pool. High quality scanners, of course, add to the dice pool, as do related skills. Before using the scanner, the user must set the scanning range, which determines the dice pool penalty if there is one. The penalty applies to all scans made at that range setting, even if the information gathered pertains to something closer. The scanner will not reveal information about things beyond that range.\r\n\r\nMedical scanner. These scanners only provide information about biological and medical issues. They can be used to diagnose a disease, or provide information about a lifeform. Medical scanners can use any medical or bio skills ‚Äì medicine, biology, zoology, genetics, zoology, xenobiology, or even psychology.\r\n\r\nMining scanner. Also known as geological scanners, these scanners provide information about substances and structures. They analyse chemicals, minerals, and materials. Mining scanners can use skills like mining, chemistry, and geology. Mining scanners are also used by archeologists.\r\n\r\nScientific scanner. These scanners provide information about energy, substances, and life-forms, but cannot be used to diagnose illnesses. Scientific scanners can use a variety of scientific skills.\r\n\r\nTactical scanner. These scanners only provide information on the number, type, and location of nearby life-forms. They are used for tactical purposes. They are more robust than other scanners. Tactical scanners use the tactics skill (which additionally means that high quality tactical scanners can add to INITIATIVE rolls).\r\n\r\nQuestions asked while using a scanner must be specific closed questions which the GM can answer in a single, short sentence. More detailed information is obtained or narrowed down by asking a series of questions. Any question within the remit of a scanner is allowed, as long as it is specific and can be answered with a single, short sentence. A typical scan sequence may look like this:\r\n\r\n1. Presence of energy sources, life-forms, or substances within range.\r\n\r\n2. Direction and approximate distance.\r\n\r\n3. Type or composition.\r\n\r\n4. More precise data.\r\n\r\nImpediments. There are various impediments to scanning attempts. Things like thick stone, shields, or severe atmospheric conditions, can each impose the standard -1d6 penalty to the attempt (as do range increments).\r\n\r\nLonger range scans. A normal scan takes one round. A longer range scan can be attempted. This takes one minute, and allows the user to multiply the range increment by 10. However, the amount of detail available becomes less granular; questions asked can only be answered with ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù.\r\n\r\nScanning creatures. When receiving information about a creature, the answer to a question may be relayed in game mechanics rather than natural English. This is a convenient way to communicate complex data and biological information to a player. It is therefore perfectly reasonable to ask ‚ÄúWhat is the reptile‚Äôs STRENGTH attribute?‚Äù and get the answer ‚Äú14‚Äù, or ‚ÄúHow much damage does its acid blood do?‚Äù and be told ‚Äú2d6‚Äù. The actual data on the scanning device is far more complicated, but this is a useful abstraction.\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

The target tries to hide their tracks, while the pursuer tries to uncover them.\r\n\r\nA simple tracking scenario involves involves AGI checks for the target and INT checks for the pursuer, along with the stealth and tracking skills, respectively.\r\n\r\nThis assumes that the target is aware of and trying to shake off the trackers.

Slatherbeasts can stomp on an adjacent prone opponent as a free action. This is an attack, and does 5d6 blunt damage.\r\nGrab. Slatherbeasts can grab opponents of size Medium or smaller when making a claw attack.  A creature struck by the grab attack is Restrained and remains so until escape.  The slatherbeast can maintain two grabs at any time. Victims grabbed automatically take 3d6+6 blunt damage at the start of their turn.\r\nSwallow whole. A Slatherbeast can transfer a grabbed victim to its mouth with a further attack.  If this attack fails, the victim is dropped and escapes. If it is successful, the victim is swallowed whole, taking 5d6+7 piercing damage in the process. The interior of a slatherbeast is intensely hot, causing 4d6 heat damage per round to the creature's victims.  Escaping from within is almost impossible, given the beast's armoured stomach (its SOAK applies within, also) designed to eat anything in the universe, but if that SOAK can be exceeded, then 20 damage in single attack will free the swallowed creature. If still alive, a swallowed creature can be freed from a dead slatherbeast; the heat damage ceases upon the slatherbeast's death.\r\nRoar. Slatherbeasts can unleash a roar so loud that its victims are stricken with fear as a 6d6 mental attack within Burst 11.  Victims successfully attacked are made Afraid. This attack affects any within range who can hear the creature, whether or not they can see it.\r\nQuake. The creature slams a foot, fist, or tail on the ground, shaking the area within 6 squares. The creature makes a 6d6 melee attack against everybody within the area, knocking targets prone and doing 1d6 damage to them.\r\nSentience. One in a thousand slatherbeasts are sentient, with LOG attributes of 4 (2d6) and the ability to speak.  Some slatherbeasts are domesticated and used for warfare - these creatures are frequently armored and trained, gaining the tactics skill at 3 (2d6) and a SOAK of 20. There are even rumours of highly intelligent, psionic slatherbeasts.\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

Additionally, the blood itself, should it come into contact with other materials, is able to eat through metal, doing 5d6 acid damage per round.\r\nTail Swipe. The xenomorph can perform a tail swipe with its barbed tail. This affects a 10-ft cone, and knocks targets prone.\r\nPoison. A xenomorph‚Äôs attack renders the target Poisoned. A victim reduced to zero HEALTH is not killed, but is dragged off and cocooned in a membrane of salvia and resin, to be used as an incubator for Facehuggers.\r\nDeath from on High.

The Matriarch can emit a roar with Burst 10, which does does a mental attack, inflicting the Afraid condition.\r\nLiving Shield. The Matriarch picks up another creature smaller than itself and uses it as a shield. The target can escape the grab as normal.

      "rawPublic": "# Customizing Monsters\r\n\r\nThe monsters in this book describe the basic creature, whether that be a mountain troll or a black orc, and are usually used as-is. However, you may wish to customize the monsters further. There are some simple tools to do this:\r\n\r\n- **Paragons (+4d6).**¬†Paragon creatures are usually (though not always) single, unique examples and may represent the progenitor of a species. These creatures are truly epic.\r\n- **Champions (+2d6).**¬† The goblin tribe may have a goblin king, or the champion fire dragon might be the most powerful of the species. While you can always use a different monster for such elite opponents, you can also turn a regular foe into a champions. Champions are  powerful opponents and represent some of the greatest of their type.\r\n- **Greater creatures (+1d6).**¬† In other cases, the faceless soldiers may be led by an experienced commander. Greater creatures are elite or leader versions of regular creatures.\r\n- **Lesser creatures (-2d6).**¬†If you simply need a weaker, or younger version of a creature, use this template. This can represent a young dragon or a knight‚Äôs squire.\r\n- **Minions (+0d6).**¬† Sometimes the heroes need to plough through legions of bad guys, mowing down their foes with heroic ease. Whether they be goblins, ninjas, or other disposable henchmen, some foes‚Äô role in the story is simply to let the protagonist show off. These are the minions.\r\n- **Careers (+1d6).**¬†These simple templates, which are analogous to PC careers,  grant a creature a few special abilities.\r\n\r\nAny monster can use an of these template types. You can have a greater black orc (+1d6), a paragon t-rex (+4d6), a goblin minion, or a fire dragon enchanter (+1d6). You can even combine them, for a paragon hill giant berserker (+5d6). A creature can be simply referred to in this format in published material, succinctly providing the GM with all the information need. For example, you might see an encounter described thusly:\r\n\r\nOn the throne is Grimstab, a greater goblin shaman. He is surrounded by six minion goblin archers, while hiding in the shadows to one side is Jerlstaff, a goblin assassin.\r\n\r\n## Paragon (+4d6)\r\n\r\nThis creature is usually unique; a paragon fire dragon might be the progenitor of dragonkind. When designated as a paragon, the following changes are made:\r\n\r\n1. Paragon creatures have triple HEALTH and double SOAK.\r\n2. Paragon creatures add +4d6 to their Maximum Dice Pool.\r\n3. Paragon creatures use their Maximum Dice Pool for all checks, including attacks.\r\n4. Paragon creatures do double damage on all attacks.\r\n5. Paragons gain one extra action per round.\r\n\r\n## Champion (+2d6)\r\n\r\nThis might be a leader or champion. Or maybe it‚Äôs just a paragon of its species. A champion doesn‚Äôt have to have underlings; but they often do. A champion has the same stat block as a regular creature of its type. Any creature can be designated as a champion, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Champions have double HEALTH and +4 SOAK (to a maximum of double SOAK).\r\n2. Champions add +2d6 to their Maximum Dice Pool.\r\n3. Champions get +2d6 to all attribute checks, including attacks.\r\n4. Champions deal an extra 2d6 damage on a successful single-target attack, or an extra 1d6 damage on a successful area attack.\r\n5. Once per round, when a champion has an adjacent minion, it can make that minion take the damage from an attack which should normally have hit the champion. The minion is immediately killed.\r\n\r\n## Greater (+1d6)\r\n\r\nThis might be a larger version of a creature, or a more experienced example. A greater creature has the same stat block as a regular creature of its type. Any creature can be designated as ‚Äúgreater‚Äù, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Greater creatures have 150% HEALTH and +2 SOAK.\r\n2. Greater creatures add +1d6 to their Maximum Dice Pool.\r\n3. Greater creatures get +1d6 to all attribute checks, including attacks.\r\n4. Greater creatures deal an extra 1d6 damage on a successful single-target attack.\r\n\r\n## Lesser (-2d6)\r\n\r\nThe dragon guards its youngling against the adventurers. One of the hill giants is weaker than the others, and his companions bully him mercilessly. These are younger or weaker versions of monsters, but they‚Äôre not cannon-fodder like minions. Any creature can be designated as ‚Äúlesser‚Äù, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Lesser creatures have half HEALTH.\r\n2. Lesser creatures have -2d6 to their Maximum Dice Pool, but cannot be reduced below 3d6.\r\n3. Lesser creatures get -2d6 to all attribute checks, including attacks.\r\n4. Lesser creatures do half damage on all attacks.\r\n5. Lesser creatures are one size category smaller than the regular creature, although this does not otherwise affect its statistics.\r\n\r\n## Minion (+0d6)\r\n\r\nMinions may be faceless minions, or the horde that surrounds the evil mastermind. A minion has the same stat block as a regular creature of its type, whether that be a bandit, a guard, a goblin, or an orc. Any creature can be designated a minion, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A minion is automatically killed with a single hit which exceeds its SOAK.\r\n2. When two or more minions are adjacent to a more powerful foe, each minion automatically deals 1 point of non-SOAKable damage (although this does not circumvent immunities) to the target at the beginning of its turn. In this way, mobs of minions can slowly bring down a more powerful foe while being easily dispatched one at a time.\r\n3. When a greater creature is killed, minions tend to break and flee. If a minion witnesses the death of an allied greater creature, it will stop fighting. It will flee if possible, and surrender if not. If there is still a greater creature remaining (i.e. there were multiple greater creatures to begin with), half of the minions will break, while the other half continues to fight. Determine which minions flee and which minions fight randomly.\r\n\r\nAs the PCs increase in grade, so does the pool of available minions. To appropriately powerful PCs, even trolls, vampire spawn, and velociraptors might eventually qualify as minions, at the GM‚Äôs discretion.\r\n\r\n## Zinhorn the Champion Tyrannosaur Druid\r\n\r\nThis is an example of a champion tyrannosaur druid. It uses the tyrannosaur as the base monster with the champion template and the druid suggestions from the [monster creation guidelines](/bestiary/creating-monsters).\r\n\r\n### Zinhorn\r\n\r\nEnormous sentient reptile (14d6)\r\nSTR 28 (7d6) AGI 10 (4d6) END 28 (7d6)\r\nINT 10 (4d6) LOG 4 (2d6) WIL 21 (6d6) \r\nCHA 10 (4d6) LUC 3 (2d6) REP 21 (6d6)\r\nMELEE DEFENCE 40\r\nRANGED DEFENCE 14\r\nMENTAL DEFENCE 22\r\nVITAL DEFENCE 48\r\nHEALTH 330\r\nSOAK 27; VULN 1d6 cold\r\nIMMUNE none\r\nINITIATIVE 8d6\r\nPERCEPTION 5d6 (motion 7d6)\r\nSPEED 6; CLIMB -; JUMP -\r\nCARRY 560lb (max lift 1400lb)\r\nREACH 10-ft\r\nACTIONS 3\r\nüÖú Bite 13d6 melee (8d6+7 piercing damage)\r\nüÖú Tail swipe 11d6 melee (6d6 blunt damage; cone 6)\r\nüÖ• Entangle 14d6 vital (range 10; restrained)\r\nSkills combat 10 (4d6), hearing 3 (2d6), reactions 3 (2d6), hunting 10 (4d6)\r\n\r\n## \r\n\r\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\r\n\r\nCharge. Once per turn, Zinhorn can move its speed in a straight line and then attack at the end of it, all as a single action. It  gains +1d6 damage to its attack.\r\nRoar. Zinhorn can unleash a roar so loud that its victims are stricken with fear.  A roar is an 8d6 mental attack, and attacks any creature within Burst 11. Victims successfully attacked are rendered Afraid.\r\nTail swipe. Zinhorn has a tail swipe attack. This attack affects all targets in a 30' cone to the rear of the creature.\r\nMinions. Once per round, when Zinhorn has an adjacent minion, it can make that minion take the damage from an attack which should normally have hit Zinhorn. The minion is immediately killed.\r\nMovement. Zinhorn can move through woodland areas and thick undergrowth without any speed reduction, and leave no tracks or traces of its passing unless it chooses to do so.\r\nShapechange. Zinhorn may transform into a small or medium-sized animal (and back again) once per day for up to one hour. It cannot speak in this form, and retains its own mental attributes, but otherwise uses the animal‚Äôs statistics.\r\nEntangle. Zinhorn can inflct the Restrained condition on a foe within 10 squares.\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

      "rawPublic": "# Biomech\r\n\r\nBiomech artifacts are extensions of an alien machine Entity. Hive trees, conversion factories for the Entity, are protected by mechanical spider-like hunter drones, which also collect victims for the hive trees to convert. Scout drones are smaller explorers, roughly the size of a large cat, which seek viable victims, inject them with a tracking nanite, which the hunter drones use to locate and capture them.\r\n\r\nHive trees are the result of nanite corruption crossing over into plant life. They are used as energy production and storage factories for the machine Entity. Those trees which bear fruit have been converted to a more sinister purpose: supporting cocoons from which the Entity can more efficiently convert other host-species.\r\n\r\nA hive tree resembles its host tree, but its leaves are slicked over with a thin layer of silicate, which act as photovoltaic cells. Power conduits gleam and strobe just beneath the tree‚Äôs bark, emitting unsettling flashes, pulses, and streamers of light. The bark is reinforced with thin metallic filaments, which act as a low-grade armor, while leaving the woody bark to act as natural electromagnetic shielding.\r\n\r\nElongated, pulsing sac-like cocoons, dangle from the thicker, lower branches, or bulge, tumor-like, from the girth of the trunk. These cocoons are made of a tough, fibrous material similar to kevlar, but somewhat more transparent. The steady orange-red glow from within is interspersed with twinkling and pulsing lights. The hazy silhouette of whatever creature may be in the process of mechanization can be seen in the murky depths of a cocoon, but exact details can not be made out (perhaps for the best for the casual observer).\r\n\r\nHive trees cannot move, and normally rely on hunter-killers for defense. As a last resort, the hive tree can lash out with its filament-infused vine-like growths. The Entity also uses hive trees to ‚Äòevolve‚Äô drones into either hunters, or hunter-killers if its own full production capabilities are not online.\r\n\r\n## Biomech Hunter Drone\r\n\r\nMedium semi-sentient mechanoid (6d6)\r\nSTR 6 (3d6) AGI 10 (4d6) END 6 (3d6)\r\nINT 6 (3d6) LOG 1 (1d6) WIL 6 (3d6)\r\nCHA 6 (3d6) LUC 1 (1d6) REP 6 (3d6)\r\nMELEE DEFENCE 24\r\nRANGED DEFENCE 18\r\nMENTAL DEFENCE 12 (immune)\r\nVITAL DEFENCE 18\r\nHEALTH 36\r\nSOAK 6; VULN 1d6 electricity, 2d6 ion\r\nIMMUNE Sick, Fatigued\r\nINITIATIVE 6d6\r\nPERCEPTION 5d6; lifesense\r\nSPEED 6; CLIMB 3; JUMP 20'/6'\r\nCARRY 120lb (max lift 300lb)\r\nREACH 5-ft\r\nACTIONS 2\r\nüÖú Bite 6d6 melee (3d6+3 piercing/electricity damage; nanites)\r\nSkills stealth 3 (2d6), perception 4 (2d6), reactions 6 (3d6). combat 6 (3d6)\r\nGear -     \r\n\r\n## \r\n\r\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ               \r\n\r\nNanites.

A ghost's telekinesis attack allows it to fling nearby objects at its foes.\r\nUnearthly keen.  A ghost can emit an unearthly wailing keen which makes a mental atack against all living creatures who can hear it. Those successfully hit by the attack are made Afraid.

A living nightmare is immune to physical attacks which do not do psionic, light, or holy damage.\r\nTelepathy. Living nightmares communicate via telepathy; this ability is independent of language and can be used to converse with any creature it can see.\r\nAssume Nightmare. A living nightmare embodies one of the below emotions.  In addition to any specific effects of that transformation, assuming a nightmare transforms the living nightmare into a new form related to that emotion.\r\nAnger. Mocking Gaze. The target is rendered enraged on a successful  mental attack.\r\nDread. Dread Visage. Any who can see the living nightmare immediately becomes nervous. Each round they begin within 30 feet of the living nightmare they must also make a Difficult [16] WIL check or become Afraid.\r\nGreed. Covetous Glance. As a single action, a living nightmare can look longingly at two targets, making a mental attack against the target with the lowest MENTAL DEFENSE. If successful, the does not treat the second target as an ally for one minute, and cannot benefit from or provide bonuses such as flanking from them.\r\nShame. Secret Shame. As a free action, a living nightmare can cause a target within 30 feet to focus momentarily on their deepest shame. The living nightmare makes a mental attack, and if successful the target is rendered Dazed.\r\nAssume Shape. A living nightmare can assume any form it chooses, though this form always remains medium-sized, even if the creature or object it appears as would be larger or smaller. No matter what form it assumes, the change is entirely cosmetic and has no effect on the living nightmare‚Äôs statistics. For instance, if the living nightmare were to assume the form of a dragon, it would not gain any extra attacks or a breath weapon, and it would appear as a medium-sized dragon.\r\nDeep Slumber. A living nightmare renders one target severely Sleeping, or all targets within 30' Sleeping, with a mental attack. The sleep is fitful and full of nightmares. This condition can be shaken off as normal.\r\n\r\nSource: ~License\r\n",

When reduced to zero HEALTH, a vampire is not slain. Instead, it is paralysed. In order to slay a vampire, it must either be beheaded or staked in the heart. A vampire can remain paralysed for centuries, returning to unlife with a drop of nourishing blood. A called shot to the heart with a wooden stake can paralyse a vampire instantly.\r\nSunlight. Every turn that a vampire begins in direct sunlight, it suffers 1d6 fire damage. Even when not in direct sunlight, vampires suffer -2d6 to all dice pools during daylight hours.\r\nApotropaics. Certain items can ward off vampires. Good holy items, and garlic, inflict a -1d6 die penalty to any attribute check made by the vampire if within 10' of the offending object. This also causes considerable discomfort to the vampire.\r\nInvitations.  Vampires cannot enter a private dwelling without an invitation from somebody who lives there.   Once an invitation has been extended, the vampire may enter freely thereafter.\r\nPreternatural celerity.  Vampires can move incredibly fast. Once per round, on its turn, a vampire can move its SPEED as a free action, appearing as little more than a blur to onlookers.\r\nSpiderclimb.  Vampires can scale vertical surfaces as though they were horizontal. A vampire gains a CLIMB speed equal to its regular SPEED.\r\nRegeneration. Vampires regenerate 2d6 HEALTH at the start of every turn.  This power only works at night.\r\nCharm. Vampires can make a 5d6 mental attack as a single action against any target within 30'. If successful, the target is Charmed.\r\nChildren of the night. Once per day when in an outdoor environment, vampires can spend two actions to summon 1d6 wolves which arrive within 1d6 turns and remain under the vampire's control. This power only works at night.\r\nShapechange. Avampire can spend two actions to change into the shape of a wolf or a bat. It can change back by spending a further two actions. This power only works at night.\r\nDark arts. Vampires can create magical effects equivalent to a cantrip related to darkness or mists.\r\nBlood drain. A bite attack allows the vampire to sink its teeth into its victim and drain its blood. This reduces the victim's END dice pool by 1d6 but does not do normal damage.  When the dice pool reaches 0d6, the victim is slain. A creature slain by the drinking of its blood by a vampire rises three days later as a vampire under its creator's control.
