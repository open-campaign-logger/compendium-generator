There are many subspecies of dragon, many of which are distinguished by the colour of their scales. All dragons are egg-layers and hoard treasure in their lairs, far from areas of human civilisation.\r\nstats:\r\n- Behaviour: Chaotic dragons usually try to eat humans, but may sometimes capture them. Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties worthy of the honour.\r\n- Pride: Dragons are immensely proud creatures and will always listen to flattery.\r\n- Attack pattern: A dragon always attacks first with its breath weapon, then either breathes again or makes melee attacks (equal chance of either).\r\n- Breath weapon: Can be used up to three times per day. All caught in the area suffer damage equal to the dragon’s current hit points (save versus breath for half). Shapes of breath weapon:\r\n- Cloud: 50’ long, 40’ wide, 20’ high.\r\n- Cone: 2’ wide at the mouth, 30’ wide at far end.\r\n- Line: 5’ wide along whole length.\r\n- Energy immunity: Unharmed by their own breath weapon or lesser versions thereof. Automatically save versus similar attack forms. (For example, a red dragon is immune to flaming oil and suffers half damage from fire ball spells.)\r\n- Language and spells: Some dragons are able to speak (their own tongue plus Common). The chance is listed by subspecies. Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected magic-user spells (the listed number and level of spells).\r\n- Sleeping: The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus to hit. Dragons may sometimes pretend to be asleep!\r\n- Subduing: Will surrender if reduced to 0hp by non-lethal attacks (see Subduing), admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the damage done by the breath weapon.) A subdued dragon will attempt to escape or attack its captors, if the opportunity presents itself or if given a suicidal command. A subdued dragon may be sold for up to 1,000gp per hp.\r\n- Age: The following stats describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less and ¼ or ½ as much treasure. Older dragons may have up to 3 HD more and twice as much treasure.\r\n- Lairs: A dragon’s treasure is always kept in its well-hidden lair and is seldom unguarded.\r\ntraits:\r\n```\r\n~\"Black Dragon\"\r\n~\"Blue Dragon\"\r\n~\"Gold Dragon\"\r\n~\"Green Dragon\"\r\n~\"Red Dragon\"\r\n~\"Sea Dragon\"\r\n~\"White Dragon\"\r\n\r\nSource: ~\"Necrotic Gnome OGL\"\r\n\r\n",
