A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 ft. of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.\r\n- Probing Telepathy: >\r\n    If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature.\r\nactions:\r\n- Multiattack: >\r\n    The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.\r\n- Tentacle: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher.

The charmed target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.\r\n    Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.\r\n- Legendary Actions: The aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\r\n    **Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\r\n    To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.\r\nactions:\r\n- Multiattack: >\r\n    The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.\r\n- Scimitar: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.\r\n    A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Systems Reference Document by Wizards of the Coast](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd)\r\n```\r\n",

It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\r\n    At will: detect magic\r\n    3/day each: enlarge/reduce, tongues\r\n    1/day each: conjure elemental (fire elemental only), gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift, wall of fire\r\n- Variant: Genie Powers: >\r\n    Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.\r\n    **Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\r\n    **Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\r\n    To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.\r\nactions:\r\n- Multiattack: >\r\n    The efreeti makes two scimitar attacks or uses its Hurl Flame twice.\r\n- Scimitar: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\r\n    At will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery\r\n- Mimicry: >\r\n    The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.\r\n- Hag Coven: >\r\n    When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\r\n    A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\r\n- Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only): >\r\n    While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\r\n- 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\r\n- 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\r\n- 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\r\n- 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\r\n- 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\r\n- 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\r\n    For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\r\n- Hag Eye (Coven Only): >\r\n    A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\r\n    A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\r\nactions:\r\n- Claws: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.\r\n- Illusory Appearance: >\r\n    The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\r\n    The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.\r\n- Invisible Passage: >\r\n    The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Systems Reference Document by Wizards of the Coast](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd)\r\n```\r\n",

The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.\r\n    Soul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).\r\n- Hag Coven: >\r\n    When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\r\n    A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\r\n- Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only): >\r\n    While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\r\n- 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\r\n- 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\r\n- 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\r\n- 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\r\n- 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\r\n- 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\r\n    For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\r\n- Hag Eye (Coven Only): >\r\n    A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\r\n    A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\r\nactions:\r\n- Claws (Hag Form Only): >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.\r\n- Change Shape: >\r\n    The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.\r\n- Etherealness: >\r\n    The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.\r\n- Nightmare Haunting (1/Day): >\r\n    While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Systems Reference Document by Wizards of the Coast](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd)\r\n```\r\n",

On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.\r\n    Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.\r\n- Hag Coven: >\r\n    When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\r\n    A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\r\n- Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only): >\r\n    While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\r\n- 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\r\n- 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\r\n- 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\r\n- 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\r\n- 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\r\n- 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\r\n    For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\r\n- Hag Eye (Coven Only): >\r\n    A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\r\n    A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\r\nactions:\r\n- Claws: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.\r\n- Death Glare: >\r\n    The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 ft. of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.\r\n- Illusory Appearance: >\r\n    The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\r\n    The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Systems Reference Document by Wizards of the Coast](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd)\r\n```\r\n",

It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.\r\n- Legendary Resistance (3/Day): >\r\n    If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\r\n- Misty Escape: >\r\n    When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water.

Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.\r\n- Charm: >\r\n    The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack.\r\n    Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.\r\n- Children of the Night (1/Day): >\r\n    The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up.

In its material form, it has resistance to damage from nonmagical attacks. In its ethereal form, it is immune to damage from nonmagical attacks. The creature's ethereal form appears as a dark purple outline of its material form, with a blackish-purple haze within. A nihileth in ethereal form can move through air as though it were water, with a fly speed of 40 feet.\r\n- Void Aura: >\r\n    The undead nihileth is surrounded by a chilling cloud. A living creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a nihileth must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be slowed until the start of its next turn. In addition, any creature that has been diseased by a nihileth or a nihilethic zombie takes 7 (2d6) cold damage every time it starts its turn within the aura.\r\n- Infecting Telepathy: >\r\n    If a creature communicates telepathically with the nihileth, or uses a psychic attack against it, the nihileth can spread its disease to the creature.

The nihileth cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row.\r\n    - Void Absorbance: A nihileth can pull the life force from those it has converted to nihilethic zombies to replenish its own life. This takes 18 (6d6) hit points from zombies within 30 feet of the nihileth, spread evenly between the zombies, and healing the nihileth. If a zombie reaches 0 hit points from this action, it perishes with no Undead Fortitude saving throw.\r\n- Regional Effects: >\r\n    the regional effects of a nihileth's lair are the same as that of an aboleth, except as following.\r\n    - Water sources within 1 mile of a nihileth's lair are not only supernaturally fouled but can spread the disease of the nihileth. A creature who drinks from such water must make a successful DC 14 Constitution check or become infected.\r\nactions:\r\n- Multiattack: >\r\n    The nihileth makes three tentacle attacks or three withering touches, depending on what form it is in.\r\n- Tentacle (Material Form Only): >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target creature is hit, it must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute; during that time, it can be removed by lesser restoration or comparable magic. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy. The creature cannot regain hit points unless it is entirely underwater, and the disease can only be removed by heal or comparable magic. Unless the creature is fully submerged or frequently doused with water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes. If a creature dies while diseased, it rises in 1d6 rounds as a nihilethic zombie. This zombie is permanently dominated by the nihileth.\r\n- Withering Touch (Ethereal Form Only): >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) necrotic damage.\r\n- Form Swap: >\r\n    As a bonus action, the nihileth can alter between its material and ethereal forms at will.\r\n- Tail (Material Form Only): >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.\r\n- Enslave (3/day): >\r\n    The nihileth targets one creature it can see within 30 ft. of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the nihileth until the nihileth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the nihileth's control and can't take reactions, and the nihileth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the nihileth.\r\n- Reactions: The Aboleth, Nihilith has the following reactions.\r\n- Void Body: >\r\n    The nihileth can reduce the damage it takes from a single source to 0. Radiant damage can only be reduced by half.\r\n- Legendary Actions: A nihileth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The nihileth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\r\n-  Detect: >\r\n    The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.\r\n-  Tail Swipe: >\r\n    The aboleth makes one tail attack.\r\n-  Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions): >\r\n    One creature charmed by the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-for-5th-edition-print/)\r\n```\r\n",

The infected creature makes another DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the end of each long rest; a successful save removes one level of exhaustion. If the saving throw fails, the disease persists.

The cage (AC 19, 10 hp) is considered an equipped object when borne by a derro and cannot be attacked directly. In addition, the cage protects the occupant from up to 20 spell levels of spells 4th level or lower but provides no protection to those outside of the cage. Spells of level 5 or higher take full, normal effect against the cage and its occupant. Once the cage protects against 20 or more spell levels it is rendered non-magical. If exposed to direct sunlight for over one hour of cumulative time it is destroyed.\r\n- Madness: >\r\n    A derro fetal savant's particular madness grants it immunity to psychic effects. It cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of a wish spell or comparable magic. A derro fetal savant brought to sanity gains 4 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma.\r\n- Vulnerability to Sunlight: >\r\n    A derro fetal savant takes 1 point of Constitution damage for every hour it is exposed to sunlight, and it dies if its Constitution score reaches 0. Lost Constitution points are recovered at the rate of 1/day spent underground or otherwise sheltered from the sun.\r\nactions:\r\n- Babble: >\r\n    The sight of potential host bodies so excites the fetal savant that it babbles and giggles madly and childishly, creating an insanity effect. All sane creatures that start their turns within 60 feet of the fetal savant must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be affected by confusion (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds. This is a psychic effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same fetal savant's babbling for 24 hours. This action cannot be taken when the fetal savant is using Soul Exchange.\r\n- Soul Exchange: >\r\n    As an action, the fetal savant can attempt to take control of a creature it can see within 90 feet, forcing an exchange of souls as a magic jar spell, using its own body as the container. The fetal savant can use this power at will, but it can exchange souls with only one other creature at a time. The victim resists the attack with a successful DC 13 Charisma saving throw. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same fetal savant's soul exchange for 24 hours. If the saving throw fails, the fetal savant takes control of the target's body and ferociously attacks nearby opponents, eyes blazing with otherworldly light. As an action, the fetal savant can shift from its host body back to its own, if it is within range, returning the victim's soul to its own body. If the host body or fetal savant is brought to 0 hit points within 90 feet of each other, the two souls return to their original bodies and the creature at 0 hit points is dying; it must make death saving throws until it dies, stabilizes, or regains hit points, as usual. If the host body or fetal savant is slain while they are more than 90 feet apart, their souls cannot return to their bodies and they are both slain. While trapped in the fetal savant's withered body, the victim is effectively paralyzed and helpless.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-for-5th-edition-print/)\r\n```\r\n",

In addition, Arbeyach summons a swarm of insects (of any type) at any point of the line. The swarm remains until destroyed, until Arbeyach dismisses it as a bonus action, or for 2 minutes.

The skin of a creature inhabited by Ia'Affrat crawls with the forms of the insects inside. Ia'Affrat can hide this telltale sign with a Charisma (Deception) check against a viewer's passive Insight.

The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\r\n- Smoke Jump: >\r\n    Ia'Affrat can travel instantly to a space in sight where there's smoke.\r\n- Whirlwind (Recharge 4-6): >\r\n    Each creature in Ia'Affrat's space must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw.

All devils have advantage on spell attacks made against the devil-marked creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed only by a remove curse spell or comparable magic. In addition, the mark detects as faintly evil and often shifts its position on the body. Paladins, witchfinders, and some clerics may consider such a mark proof that a creature has made a pact with a devil.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-for-5th-edition-print/)\r\n```\r\n",

That way you need not roll 20 times for all of them, and you reduce the number of rolls required by a factor of 4.\r\nactions:\r\n- Bite: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage.\r\n- Arcane Doubling (recharges after 10 minutes): >\r\n    A doppelrat under duress creates clones of itself at the beginning of its turn. Each round for 4 rounds, the number of live doppelrats quadruples but never exceeds 20. For example, when the doppelrat triggers arcane doubling, 1 rat becomes 4; at the start of the rat's next turn, those 4 become 16; and at the start of the rat's third turn, those 16 become 20, the maximum allowed. If one of the duplicates was destroyed between the original doppelrat's 1st and 2nd turns, then the surviving 3 would become 12, and so on. Each duplicate appears in the same space as any other rat, can either move or take an action the round it appears, and has 4 hit points and AC 13. Any surviving duplicates perish 1 minute (10 rounds) after the first ones were created. If the original doppelrat dies, its clones stop duplicating but the preexisting clones remain until their time expires. A creature can identify the original doppelrat from its duplicates as an action by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) check.\r\n- Doppeling Disease: >\r\n    At the end of a dopplerat encounter, every creature bitten by a doppelrat or its duplicates must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract the degenerate cloning disease. During each long rest, the diseased creature grows and sloughs off a stillborn clone. The doppeling process leaves the diseased creature incapacitated for 1 hour, unable to move and barely able to speak (spellcasting is impossible in this state). When the incapacitation wears off, the creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw; it recovers from the disease when it makes its second successful save. Humanoid clones created by the disease cannot be brought to life in any manner.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-for-5th-edition-print/)\r\n```\r\n",

This darkness prevents normal vision and darkvision from functioning. Blindsight and truesight function normally. Activating or deactivating the aura is a bonus action.\r\n- Earth Glide: >\r\n    An adult cave dragon glides through stone, dirt, or any sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish glides through water. Its burrowing produces no ripple or other sign of its presence and leaves no tunnel or hole unless the dragon chooses to do so; in that case, it creates a passageway 15 feet wide by 10 feet high. The spell move earth cast on an area containing an earth-gliding cave dragon flings the dragon back 30 feet and stuns the creature for one round unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw.\r\n- Legendary Resistance (3/Day): >\r\n    If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\r\n- Innate Spellcasting: >\r\n    the dragon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\r\n    at will: detect magic, speak with dead\r\n    3/day each: blur, counterspell, darkness, web\r\n    1/day each: dispel magic, hold person\r\n- Cave Dragon's Lair: >\r\n    on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action for one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\r\n    - The ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained (by fallen debris); damage is halved and the creature is not restrained if it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The creature is freed when it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.\r\n    - A ten foot-wide, ten foot-long crack opens in the cavern floor where the dragon wishes. Any creature occupying that space must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) piercing damage from the jagged stones at the bottom.\r\n    - The dragon summons a swarm of insects as if it had cast insect plague, filling a 20-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of the dragon. Creatures that are in the affected space or that enter it take 22 (4d10) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw. The swarm lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\r\n- Regional Effects: >\r\n    the region containing a legendary cave dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\r\n    - Poisonous and odorless gases suddenly fill passages and caverns, and just as quickly disperse, within six miles of the dragon's lair.\r\n    - Flash flooding turns tunnels into death traps as tremors create fissures in the stone within six miles of the lair. On the surface, ponds drain away, and long-dry creek beds break their banks in flood.\r\n    - Swarms of vermin within one mile of the lair increase in both size and number as they try to escape the dragon's endless and undiscriminating hunger.\r\n    if the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.\r\nactions:\r\n- Multiattack: >\r\n    The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.\r\n- Bite: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.

Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.\r\n- Tail: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.\r\n- Frightful Presence: >\r\n    Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.\r\n- Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6): >\r\n    The dragon exhales a cone of black poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each target in that area takes 56 (16d6) poison damage and is poisoned if it is a creature; a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw reduces damage by half and negates the poisoned condition. The poisoned condition lasts until the target takes a long or short rest or it's removed with lesser restoration or comparable magic.\r\n- Reactions: The Adult Cave Dragon has the following reactions.\r\n- Ruff Spikes: >\r\n    When a creature tries to enter a space adjacent to a cave dragon, the dragon flares its many feelers and spikes. The creature cannot enter a space adjacent to the dragon unless it makes a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature can keep moving but only into spaces that aren't within 5 feet of the dragon and takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage from spikes.\r\n- Legendary Actions: The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\r\n-  Detect: >\r\n    The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.\r\n-  Reset Ruff Spikes: >\r\n    The dragon can use its ruff spikes as a reaction again before its next turn.\r\n-  Tail: >\r\n    The dragon makes a tail attack.\r\n-  Swift Bite (Costs 2 Actions): >\r\n    The dragon makes two bite attacks.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-for-5th-edition-print/)\r\n```\r\n",

The dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\r\n    - Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\r\n    - The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, on whichever side of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\r\n    - The dragon bends time around its enemies.

Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.\r\n    - Water temperatures drop sharply within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures not accustomed to cold suffer exposure to extreme cold while swimming in this water.\r\n    - Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.\r\n    if the dragon dies, conditions of the sea surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.\r\nactions:\r\n- Multiattack: >\r\n    The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.

Each creature and object within 1 mile of the dragon take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage, 55 (10d10) cold damage, and 55 (10d10) psychic damage. Each damage type can be reduced by half with a successful DC 21 saving throw: Dexterity vs. bludgeoning, Constitution vs. cold, and Wisdom vs. psychic. Additionally, a creature that fails two or three of the saving throws is affected by a plane shift spell and sent to a random plane. If it is sent to the plane it currently occupies, it appears 5d100 miles away in a random direction.\r\n- Legendary Resistance (3/Day): >\r\n    If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\r\n- Void Dweller: >\r\n    Void dragons dwell in the empty expanse between the stars, and do not require air, food, drink, or sleep. When flying between stars the void dragon magically glides on solar winds, making the immense journey through the void in an impossibly short time.\r\n- Void Dragon's Lair: >\r\n    on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\r\n    - The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round.\r\n    - The Void briefly overlaps the dragon's lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\r\n    - The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.\r\n- Regional Effects: >\r\n    the region containing a legendary void dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\r\n    - Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.\r\n    - Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can't create bright light in this area.\r\n    - Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.\r\n    if the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.\r\nactions:\r\n- Multiattack: >\r\n    The dragon can use its Aura of Madness. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.\r\n- Bite: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) cold damage.\r\n- Claw: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.\r\n- Tail: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.\r\n- Aura of Madness: >\r\n    Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more it is driven insane. An insane creature is frightened permanently, and behaves as if affected by confusion while it is frightened in this way. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Aura of Madness for the next 24 hours.\r\n- Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6): >\r\n    The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:\r\n- Gravitic Breath: >\r\n    The dragon exhales a 90-foot cube of powerful localized gravity, originating from the dragon. Falling damage in the area increases to 1d10 per 10 feet fallen. When a creature starts its turn within the area or enters it for the first time in a turn, including when the dragon creates the field, it must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure the creature is restrained. On a success the creature's speed is halved as long as it remains in the field. A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn. The field persists until the dragon's breath recharges, and it can't use gravitic breath twice consecutively.\r\n- Stellar Flare Breath: >\r\n    The dragon exhales star fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (13d6) fire damage and 45 (13d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n- Teleport: >\r\n    The dragon magically teleports to any open space within 100 feet.\r\n- Reactions: The Ancient Void Dragon has the following reactions.\r\n- Void Twist: >\r\n    When the dragon is hit by a ranged attack, it can create a small rift in space to increase its AC by 7 against that attack. If the attack misses because of this increase, the dragon can choose a creature within 30 feet to become the new target for that attack. Use the original attack roll to determine if the attack hits the new target.\r\n- Legendary Actions: The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\r\n-  Detect: >\r\n    The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.\r\n-  Tail Attack: >\r\n    The dragon makes a tail attack.\r\n-  Void Slip (Costs 2 Actions): >\r\n    The dragon twists the fabric of space. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then teleport to an unoccupied space within 40 feet.\r\n-  Void Cache (Costs 3 Actions): >\r\n    The dragon can magically reach into its treasure hoard and retrieve one item. If the dragon is holding an item, it can use this ability to deposit the item into its hoard.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-for-5th-edition-print/)\r\n```\r\n",

The target of the drift (but not the future self) must then make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, with effects identical to those for the eonic drifter witnessing the death of its future self (see Drift Backward). The future self doesn't reappear after using this ability the second time; only the target of the drift reappears from the second use.

When a creature that can see the fear smith's eye starts its turn within 30 feet of the fear smith, the creature must make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become disoriented. While disoriented, the creature falls prone each time it tries to move or take the Dash or Disengage action. To recover from disorientation, a creature must start its turn outside the fear smith's gaze and make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. To use this ability, the fear smith can't be incapacitated and must see the affected creature. A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes at the start of its turn to avoid the effect. In that case, no saving throw is necessary but the creature treats the fear smith as invisible until the start of the creature's next turn.

A creature so afflicted must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after every long rest. On a failed save the victim takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction can't be removed until the victim recovers from darakhul fever, and even then only by greater restoration or similar magic. The victim recovers from the disease by making successful saving throws on two consecutive days. Greater restoration cures the disease; lesser restoration allows the victim to make the daily Constitution check with advantage. Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect ogres, and therefore other giants may be susceptible. If the infected creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll 1d20, add the character's current Constitution modifier, and find the result on the Adjustment Table to determine what undead form the victim's body rises in.

A paralyzed target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Creatures in the area take 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage and are pushed 15 feet directly away from Hraesvelgr, or they take half damage and are not pushed with a successful DC 19 Strength saving throw.\r\n- Legendary Actions: Hraesvelgr can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.

A swallowed creature takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of Hraesvelgr's turns. If Hraesvelgr returns to giant form, or takes 40 damage or more in a single turn from a swallowed creature, he must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which land prone within 10 feet of the giant.

While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. A charmed target that is more than 5 feet away from the harpy must move at its highest rate (including dashing, if necessary) along the most direct route to get within 5 feet of the harpy. The charmed creature doesn't maneuver to avoid opportunity attacks, but it can repeat the saving throw every time it takes damage from anything other than the harpy. It also repeats the saving throw before entering damaging terrain (lava or a pit, for example), if the most direct route includes a dangerous space. A creature also repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. A successful saving throw ends the effect on that creature and makes the creature immune to this harpy's song for 24 hours.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-for-5th-edition-print/)\r\n```\r\n",

If the whelp was attacked, this reaction occurs after the attack is made but before damage is done. Nearby creatures and objects are pushed to the nearest available space and must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. Weapons, armor, and other objects worn or carried by the hulking whelp grow (and shrink again) proportionally when it changes size. Overcome by raw emotion, it sets about destroying anything and everything it can see (which isn't much) and reach (which is quite a lot). The transformation lasts until the hulking whelp is unaware of any nearby creatures for 1 round, it drops to 0 hit points, it has 5 levels of exhaustion, or it's affected by a calm emotions spell or comparable magic. The transformation isn't entirely uncontrollable; people or creatures the whelp knows and trusts can be near it without triggering the reaction. Under the wrong conditions, such as in a populated area, a hulking whelp's Unleashed Emotion can last for days.\r\nactions:\r\n- Multiattack: >\r\n    The hulking whelp makes two slam attacks.\r\n- Slam: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.

This ability creates a hidden extra-dimensional dwelling. After creating a hidey-hole, a kikimora can teleport herself and up to 50 lb of objects to the designated location instead of making a normal move. This extradimensional space can only be entered by the kikimora or by a creature using a plane shift spell or ability. The location can be determined by casting detect magic in the area of the sigil, but it takes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to plane shift into the space. Inside the hidey-hole, a kikimora can see what is going on outside the space through a special sensor. This sensor functions like a window, and it can be blocked by mundane objects placed in front of the sigil. If she leaves an item in her space, it remains there even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. If someone else removes the sigil, all contents are emptied into the Ethereal Plane (including any beings within her hidey-hole at the time). In this case, the kikimora can attempt a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to instead eject herself (but none of her possessions) into a space adjacent to the sigil.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-for-5th-edition-print/)\r\n```\r\n",

If its tools are taken away or lost, it can cobble together a new set from wire, bits of metal, and other junk in 30 minutes.\r\n- Traps and Snares: >\r\n    The kobold trapsmith excels at setting mechanical traps. Detecting, disarming, avoiding, or mitigating its traps require successful DC 13 checks or saving throws, and the traps have +5 attack bonuses. With thief's tools and basic construction materials, a trapsmith can set up one of the simple but effective traps listed below in 5 minutes. Triggers involve pressure plates, tripwires, small catches in a lock, or other simple mechanisms.\r\n- Choke Bomb: >\r\n    This small incendiary device burns rapidly and releases choking smoke in a 20-foot sphere. The area is heavily obscured. Any breathing creature that's in the affected area when the cloud is created or that starts its turn in the cloud is poisoned. Once a poisoned creature leaves the cloud, it makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on a success. The smoke dissipates after 10 minutes, or after 1 round in a strong wind.\r\n- Poisoned Sliver: >\r\n    A poisoned sliver or needle can be hidden almost anywhere: inside a lock or a box, in a carpeted floor, on the underside of a door handle, in a cup of liquid or a bowl of gems. When someone meets the conditions for being jabbed by the sliver, the trap makes a melee weapon attack with advantage: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target; Hit: 2 (1d4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, or one-half poison damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw.\r\n- Skullpopper: >\r\n    This trap consists of either a heavy weight, a spike, or a blade, set to fall or swing into a victim. When triggered, a skullpopper makes a melee weapon attack against the first target in its path: +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target; Hit: 11 (2d10) damage. The type of damage depends on how the skullpopper is built: a stone or heavy log does bludgeoning damage, a spiked log does piercing damage, a scything blade does slashing damage, etc.\r\n- Slingsnare: >\r\n    A concealed loop of rope or wire is affixed to a counterweight. When a creature steps into the snare, it must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be yanked into the air and suspended, upside down, 5 feet above the ground. The snared creature is restrained (escape DC 13). The cord is AC 10 and has 5 hit points.\r\nactions:\r\n- Dagger: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.\r\n- Light Crossbow: >\r\n    Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, or one-half poison damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw.\r\n- Shredder (Recharge 6): >\r\n    The kobold trapsmith primes and throws a device at a point within 30 feet. The device explodes when it hits something solid, flinging razor-sharp spikes in a 15-foot-radius sphere. Every creature in the area takes 14 (4d6) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. The ground inside the spherical area is littered with spikes; it becomes difficult terrain, and a creature that falls prone in the area takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage.\r\n- Stunner (1/Day): >\r\n    Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is restrained (escape DC 13). While restrained, the target takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage at the start of its turn and falls prone. The trapsmith has advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing metal armor. A stunner is a bola made of metal wire, magnets, and static electricity capacitors. A kobold trapsmith can recharge it during a long rest.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-for-5th-edition-print/)\r\n```\r\n",

The whirlwind is 10 feet wide and up to 50 feet tall. A creature in the area of the whirlwind when it's created, or who enters the area for the first time on a turn, must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage from the buffeting wind. A restrained creature can escape from the whirlwind by using its action to repeat the saving throw; on a success, it moves 5 feet outside the area of the whirlwind. The whirlwind lasts until Koschei uses this action again or dies.\r\n    - Tortured spirits appear and attack up to three creatures Koschei can see within the lair. One attack is made against each targeted creature; each attack has +8 to hit and does 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.\r\n    - Koschei disrupts the flow of magic in his lair. Until initiative count 20 on the following round, any creature other than a fiend who targets Koschei with a spell must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature still casts the spell, but it must target a creature other than Koschei.\r\n- Regional Effects: >\r\n    the region containing Koschei's lair is warped by Koschei's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\r\n    - Rabbits, ducks, and other game animals become hostile toward intruders within 5 miles of the lair. They behave aggressively, but only attack if cornered. Foraging for food by hunting is difficult and only yields half the normal amount of food.\r\n    - Wind and snowstorms are common within 5 miles of the lair.\r\n    - Koschei is aware of any spell cast within 5 miles of his lair. He knows the source of the magic (innate, the caster's class, or a magic item) and knows the direction to the caster.\r\n    if Koschei dies, conditions in the area surrounding his lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.\r\nactions:\r\n- Multiattack: >\r\n    Koschei makes two longsword attacks and one drain life attack.\r\n- Longsword: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

The ostinato can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect. The target retains control of its body and is aware of the ostinato's presence only as a melody, not as a living entity. The target no longer needs to eat or drink, gains the ostinato's Magic Resistance trait, and has advantage on Charisma checks. It also has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and it can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects for more than a single turn. The target can make a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check once every 24 hours; on a success, it realizes that the music it hears comes from an external entity. The Aural Symbiosis lasts until the target drops to 0 hit points, the ostinato ends it as a bonus action, or the ostinato is forced out by a dispel evil and good spell or comparable magic. When the Aural Symbiosis ends, the ostinato bursts forth in a thunderous explosion of sound and reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. All creatures within 60 feet, including the original target, take 21 (6d6) thunder damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The target becomes immune to this ostinato's Aural Symbiosis for 24 hours if it succeeds on the saving throw or after the Aural Symbiosis ends.\r\n- Voracious Aura (1/Day): >\r\n    While merged with a humanoid (see Aural Symbiosis), the ostinato feeds on nearby creatures. Up to nine creatures of the ostinato's choice within 60 feet of it can be targeted. Each target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or take 3 (1d6) necrotic damage and have its hit point maximum reduced by the same amount until it finishes a long rest. The target dies if its maximum hit points are reduced to 0. Victims notice this damage immediately, but not its source.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-for-5th-edition-print/)\r\n```\r\n",

She is aware of the direction and distance to all members of the hive, can telepathically communicate with them when they are within 20 miles, and can sense what they sense when they are within 1 mile of her. Tosculi from her hive that travel more than 20 miles away instinctively know the direction and distance to the hive and try to return. Hive-queens sometimes dispatch rescue missions to recover separated members of the hive.\r\n- Hive Queen Lair: >\r\n    on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hive-queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\r\n    - The tosculi hive-queen releases a cloud of pheromones that drives the tosculi to fight harder. All tosculi within 60 feet of the hive-queen (including the hive-queen herself) regain 7 (2d6) hit points.\r\n    - A swarm of tiny tosculi offspring crawls from its nest and attacks a creature within 120 feet of the hive-queen, automatically doing 10 (4d4) piercing damage. Then the swarm dies. \r\n    - The ceiling above one creature that the hive-queen can see within 120 feet of her drips sticky resin. The creature must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be encased in rapidly-hardening resin. A creature encased this way is restrained. It can free itself, or another creature within 5 feet can free it, by using an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the creature is still encased the next time the initiative count reaches 20, the resin hardens, trapping it. The trapped creature can't move or speak; attack rolls against it have disadvantage because it is encased in resin armor; it automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws; and it has resistance to all damage. The trapped creature is released when the resin is destroyed (AC 10, 20 HP, immune to cold, fire, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and piercing damage). \r\n    the tosculi hive-queen can't repeat an effect until they have all been used, and she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.\r\n- Regional Effects: >\r\n    the region containing a tosculi hive-queen's lair is warped by the creature's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:\r\n    - Intelligent creatures within 6 miles suffer frequent headaches. It's as if they had a constant buzzing inside their heads. \r\n    - Beasts within 6 miles are more irritable and violent than usual and have the Blood Frenzy trait:The beast has advantage on melee attack rolls against a creature that doesn't have all its hit points. \r\n    if the tosculi hive-queen dies, the buzzing disappears immediately, and the beasts go back to normal within 1d10 days.\r\nactions:\r\n- Multiattack: >\r\n    The hive-queen makes four scimitar attacks.\r\n- Scimitar: >\r\n    Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

A paralyzed target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\r\n- Glitter Dust: >\r\n    The hive-queen produces a cloud of glittering golden particles in a 30-foot radius. Each creature that is not a tosculi in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\r\n- Implant Egg: >\r\n    The hive-queen implants an egg into an incapacitated creature within 5 feet of her that is neither undead nor a construct. Until the egg hatches or is removed, the creature is poisoned, paralyzed, and does not need to eat or drink. The egg hatches in 1d6 weeks, and the larval tosculi kills the host creature. The implanted egg can be removed with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check or by a spell or magical effect that cures disease.\r\n- Legendary Actions: The hive-queen can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

It can be reached with an hour or two of hard digging.\r\n- Rootlet Swarms: >\r\n    The vesiculosa is surrounded at all times by four Medium swarms of Tiny rootlets that move as the vesiculosa directs. Each swarm has a speed of 30 feet, can be targeted independently, has 25 hit points, and (unlike the parent plant) quite vulnerable to fire damage. Other than that, they have the same statistics as the vesiculosa's main body. For each swarm that drops to 0 hit points, the vesiculosa loses one of its Entrap attacks. A destroyed swarm regrows in 24 hours.\r\n- Sweet Water: >\r\n    The vesiculosa's pool emits a sweet fragrance that lures creatures to drink. Creatures that are neither undead nor constructs within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to approach the vesiculosa and drink. The water is cool and refreshing but carries a sleeping poison: any creature (other than undead and constructs) that drinks from it regains 1d4 hp and recovers from 1 level of exhaustion, but must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against poison or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

It loses one Entrap attack for each rootlet swarm that's been destroyed.\r\n- Entrap: >\r\n    The vesiculosa targets a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of one of its rootlet swarms. The target takes 10 (4d4) piercing damage and is grappled (escape DC 15), or takes half damage and isn't grappled if it makes a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and that rootlet swarm can't entrap another target.\r\n- Reel: >\r\n    Each rootlet swarm that has a creature grappled moves up to 20 feet toward the vesiculosa's main body. Rootlets wander up to 100 feet from the main body.\r\n- Engulf: >\r\n    The vesiculosa engulfs all restrained or unconscious creatures within 5 feet of its main body (up to 2 Large, 4 Medium or 8 Small creatures). An engulfed creature is restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the vesiculosa, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the vesiculosa's turns. When the vesiculosa moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by using an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the vesiculosa's main body.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-for-5th-edition-print/)\r\n```\r\n",

In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hp, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.\r\n    The dragon can choose to transform only part of its body with this action, allowing it to sprout rabbit-like ears or a humanoid head. These changes are purely cosmetic and don’t alter statistics.\r\n- Legendary Actions: The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\r\n-  Detect: >\r\n    The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.\r\n-  Tail Attack: >\r\n    The dragon makes a tail attack.\r\n-  Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions): >\r\n    The dragon casts a spell from its list of innate spells, consuming a use of the spell as normal.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts 2 Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-2-for-5th-edition/)\r\n```\r\n",

The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and, after 1d4 rounds, the creature is petrified. A creature petrified by the ooze remains petrified until 24 hours after it exits the ooze. When the ooze moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.\r\n    An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the ooze.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts 2 Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-2-for-5th-edition/)\r\n```\r\n",

Temporary hp gained from this trait replenish every 1 minute.\r\nactions:\r\n- Phrenic Antennae: >\r\n    Melee Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

The charmed ally becomes the target of the attack instead. If the charmed ally takes damage from this attack, it can immediately repeat the Fragrant Aura’s saving throw, ending the charmed condition on itself on a success.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts 2 Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-2-for-5th-edition/)\r\n```\r\n",

If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of its next turn.\r\n- Spider Climb: >\r\n    The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.\r\n- Vampire Weaknesses: >\r\n    The vampire has the following flaws:\r\n    * Forbiddance. The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.\r\n    * Harmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.\r\n    * Stake to the Heart.

If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated for 1 minute. While incapacitated, its speed is reduced to 0 and its mind is overwhelmed with a flood of its own insecurities, shortcomings and inability to accomplish its goals. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The target can also repeat the saving throw if another creature uses an action to shake the target out of its stupor.\r\n- Psychic Assault: >\r\n    The vampire chooses one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage and suffer memory loss, and the vampire regains hp equal to the psychic damage dealt. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire’s control. The target’s memory loss can manifest in a variety of ways. Roll a d4 and consult the table below. If the target is already affected by one of these options, roll again, unless otherwise noted. The memory loss lasts until it is cured by a greater restoration spell or similar magic.\r\n    | d4 | Memory Loss |\r\n    |----|-------------|\r\n    | 1 | The target forgets how to use a particular skill or tool. It has disadvantage on one random skill or tool proficiency. If the target is already affected by this memory loss, randomly choose an additional skill or tool proficiency to also be affected. |\r\n    | 2 | The target forgets one of its current allies and now views the ally as hostile. If the target is already affected by this memory loss, choose an additional ally. |\r\n    | 3 | The target forgets key aspects of fighting and has disadvantage on its first attack roll each turn. |\r\n    | 4 | The target forgets how to defend itself properly, and the first attack roll against it each turn has advantage. |\r\n- Knowledge Keepers (1/Day): >\r\n    The vampire magically calls 2d4 inklings or 1 paper golem swarm. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.\r\n- Legendary Actions: The psychic vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\r\n-  Move: >\r\n    The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If it uses this legendary action while levitating, the vampire can move up to half its speed horizontally instead.\r\n-  Unarmed Strike: >\r\n    The vampire makes one unarmed strike.\r\n-  Psychic Pulse (Costs 3 Actions): >\r\n    The vampire releases a powerful wave of psychic energy. Each creature within 20 feet of the vampire must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts 2 Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-2-for-5th-edition/)\r\n```\r\n",

The reductions last until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature’s Strength or Dexterity to 0, the creature dies. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws against the disease recovers from it. Alternatively, the disease can be removed by the lesser restoration spell or similar magic.\r\n- Bonerot Sense: >\r\n    The pustulent shambler can pinpoint the location of creatures infected with bonerot within 60 feet of it and can sense the general direction of such creatures within 1 mile of it.\r\n- Corrosive to Bone: >\r\n    A creature with exposed bones (such as a skeleton) that touches the shambler or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of bone that hits the shambler corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of bone that hits the shambler is destroyed after dealing damage.\r\n- Stench: >\r\n    Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the pustulent shambler must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.

The shambler can’t use Absorb Flesh on a corpse if it or another pustulent shambler has already used Absorb Flesh on the corpse. If the corpse has intact bones, the shambler loses its Amorphous trait for 1 minute.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts 2 Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-2-for-5th-edition/)\r\n```\r\n",

If the vallowex takes 15 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the vallowex must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the vallowex.

The eggs live for 1 hour. Any humanoid or beast that drinks the eggs must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease—a vallowex tadpole. A host can carry only one vallowex tadpole to term at a time. While diseased, the host must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each long rest. On a failed save, the host’s Strength score is reduced by 1d4. This reduction lasts until the host finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the host’s Strength score is reduced to 0, the host dies, and a vallowex emerges from the corpse. If the host succeeds on three saving throws or the disease is magically cured, the unborn tadpole disintegrates.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts 2 Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-2-for-5th-edition/)\r\n```\r\n",

The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.\r\n- Turn Resistance: >\r\n    The lich has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.\r\n- Versatile Artist: >\r\n    At the end of each long rest, the lich chooses one form of artistic expression, such as song, poetry, dance, fashion, paint, or similar. Until it finishes a long rest, the lich has immunity to one type of damage, which is associated with its artistic expression. For example, a lich expressing art through song or poetry has immunity to thunder damage, a lich expressing art through fashion has immunity to slashing damage, and a lich expressing art through paint has immunity to acid damage. This trait can’t give the lich immunity to force, psychic, or radiant damage.\r\n- Spellcasting: >\r\n    The virtuoso lich is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following bard spells prepared:\r\n- Cantrips (at will): mage hand, message, true strike, vicious mockery\r\n- 1st level (4 slots): bane, hideous laughter, thunderwave\r\n- 2nd level (3 slots): enthrall, hold person, invisibility, shatter\r\n- 3rd level (3 slots): dispel magic, fear, speak with dead\r\n- 4th level (3 slots): compulsion, confusion, dimension door\r\n- 5th level (2 slots): dominate person, mislead\r\n- 6th level (1 slot): irresistible dance, programmed illusion\r\nactions:\r\n- Multiattack: >\r\n    The virtuoso lich uses its Corrupted Art. It then makes two Artistic Flourish attacks.\r\n- Artistic Flourish: >\r\n    Melee Spell Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

This action’s effects change, depending on if the target is undead. \r\n    * Non-Undead. The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. \r\n    * Undead. The target regains 18 (4d8) hit points. Healing that exceeds the target’s hp maximum becomes temporary hit points.\r\n- Call Muse: >\r\n    The lich targets one humanoid or beast it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the lich for 1 minute. The charmed target, the lich’s “muse,” has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated as it watches or listens to the lich’s artistic expression. The muse can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the lich’s Call Muse for the next 24 hours. If the muse suffers harm from the lich, it is no longer charmed.\r\n    The lich can have only one muse at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous muse ends. If the lich is within 30 feet of its muse and can see its muse, the lich has advantage on its first Artistic Flourish attack each round against a creature that isn’t its muse.\r\n- Legendary Actions: The virtuoso lich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The lich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\r\n-  Artistic Flourish: >\r\n    The lich makes one Artistic Flourish attack.\r\n-  Move: >\r\n    The lich moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.\r\n-  Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions): >\r\n    The lich casts a spell from its list of prepared spells, using a spell slot as normal.\r\n-  Unrestrained Art (Costs 3 Actions): >\r\n    The lich unleashes the full force of its artistic talents on those nearby. Each creature with 10 feet of the lich must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 18 (4d8) damage of the type chosen with the Versatile Artist trait and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.\r\n\r\nLicense: [Tome of Beasts 2 Open-Gaming License Content by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-2-for-5th-edition/)\r\n```\r\n",
